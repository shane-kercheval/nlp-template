Anyone have experience for the broadcast range of the x vs the s? I just bought an x and the range is very very limited vs My hand clicker. It's like _NUMBER_ feet vs the _NUMBER_ feet to open my gates. Beyond being weaker than the hand clicker I had a loaner model S ( _NUMBER_ ) and it had a pretty nice broadcast range similar to my hand clicker. This is important to me as my gates open outward and I need to get perilously close to activate the gates. I mean come on, a few more broadcasting watts would do the trick. Do you think they actually tried to save power on this transmitter?
My phone did a random hard reset where it cleared all of my Bluetooth pairings. Now when I try to reconnect to my Honda the Honda remembers my phone but my phone doesn't recognize the Honda. I think I need to delete my phone from the Honda so I can freshly add it. But i don't know how to
_NUMBER_ AMG C43 107k miles My mechanic installed a new starter motor in January _NUMBER_ and it already started to die on me. Took it in today and he said the starter motor requires grease at least once a year (while failing to recognize that it's been less than a year). He never said anything about that in January when he installed it. Is this legit, or should I find a new mechanic? He's been pretty good for the lifespan of the car until now, but now I'm starting to wonder...
Hey everyone. So, my _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ Aero is sitting around 108k miles and has a coolant leak from the water pump. My local Saab specialty shop says I just need a new pump, and that's fine. However, I'm not about to spend $ _NUMBER_ for the refurbished part that they sourced from a junkyard car or something. I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar issue and knows a good place to get the part. I looked on EEuroparts and a GenuineSaab part is around $ _NUMBER_ , while other aftermarket parts from companies that I've never heard of range from $ _NUMBER_ -$ _NUMBER_ . I also went on eBay and found them from $ _NUMBER_ to $ _NUMBER_ ...Not sure if any of these parts should be trusted or not. Any input or help is appreciated!
Noticed it driving to work this morning, heard a high pitched whine coming from the engine looked at my speedo and saw I was going 55mph at _NUMBER_ revs, drove it home at the end of the day and it looked like she didnt want to go from 3rd into 4th. No idea where to start with this.
_URL_ There's no point where the metal is contacting the rubber. I'm able to slide a pen between the fender and tire pretty easily. I also needed to make a doctor's appointment, and noticed no wobble or alignment issues, though the lousy Austin roads make separating their issue from mine difficult _EMOJI_ . I'm able to remove the fender myself, but will a rubber mallet and below grease suffice to working some shape back into the metal?
I posted a while back asking about going on a road trip with some long uphill mountain drives and got some really good feedback. I'm happy to say the Volt preformed spectacularly. From West Phoenix to Flagstaff with lots of driving around in town, then the opportunity to charge at night, I used just over _NUMBER_ gallons of gas. While the mileage numbers might not stand out at all, keep in mind this was almost uphill with the adaptive cruise set between _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ MPH with eco A/C most of the way. I engaged mountain mode with about _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ battery left just outside of town once the speed limit hit _NUMBER_ , and this car just powered up the hills without missing a beat. One of the things I noticed that I loved was the lack of shifting gears to get the optimum power. Climbing these hills with my old V8 Jeep, the cruise would violently downshift to maintain speed. Not the Volt, it just keeps climbing and climbing at a steady smooth rate. I forgot to take a picture of my mileage going back to Phoenix, but I used just about _NUMBER_ gallons of gas to get back home going about the same speed. Love how the cruise keeps the vehicle at the proper speed going downhill while recharging the battery. Those sections felt like driving for free! To sum it up, I was a bit nervous about my first trip going uphill, and it was just spectacular. So just giving some input to anyone worried about driving their Volt or buying one because of mountain grades. Again, thanks for the advice I received in this subreddit to my previous post!
So I bought my car used and I've been thinking of lowering it but I realized that the front end sits about an inch closer to the tire than the back end. Did this model come stock like that or did the previous owner put lowering springs on the front? And would it be fine to lower just the back end without changing the front?
We have a sportwagen that we use as our daily driver, and our long distance camping vehicle in the summer. We have a trailer hitch installed (with a shelf) and when we have any sort of load on it, the rear suspension gets Very low (like enough that it looks like it could drag the top of the tire against the wheel well). I'm wondering, would there be a way to buy improved shocks/struts that would maybe give us a bit more ability to carry more without bottoming out, without ruining our daily driving as well? Has anyone ever done this or heard of doing it?
So..My wife drove my _NUMBER_ Santa Fe while I was not in town and did not get an oil changed...The oil changed interval is every 5000km with full synthetic oil but it's now _NUMBER_ +km passed the oil change interval..I'm getting it changed ASAP but before I do so, should I get a engine flush then get the oil changed since the engine is probably full of gunk by now? I read online a lot of people not recommending engine flushes esp on a modern car like this...Please help because I've never had this happen before...
Would love to get a Limited but I can't tell if I'm getting jerked around by the dealers around here as they are giving me kind of high quotes even on an SEL (like $17kish OTD) Has anyone else bought a _NUMBER_ recently that wouldn't mind telling me their OTD price?
I took my _NUMBER_ JKX to get a state inspection, I failed it because he tested the suspension, the guy at the place stated I need to replace my upper/lower ball joints on the car, is that what needs to be done? I have a rejection sticker now and I want to take care of this issue but its a _NUMBER_ bill to replace the ball joints? any other issues? the guy at midas did mention a sway bar issue I want to make sure that if I replace the ball joints I will pass inspection.
So I'm completely new to modding and was looking at AM, but I wasn't even sure where to start. I'm pretty limited on accessories because it's a convertible. I am planning on starting with the exhaust system because I love a good rumble, but I've also read that I should upgrade air intake. Budget is probably around $ _NUMBER_ for my first piece. Thanks in advance :)
I bought a used road king with one of those easy on/off windshields with the _NUMBER_ rubber connecting points. I haven't used it at all though because I feel like theres nothing actually "locking" it in place. Those springy metal wire things actually ended up scratched some paint near the rubber attach points. Is it safe to just put on the windshield and cut off those annoying springy metal wires?
First off just want to say thank you for anyone who has any info about this or past experience with these cars. I was ignorant to have not fixed it sooner and I hate to bring this up even though it might be a simple fix. This has been a problem for about a year or so, just never got around to fixing it. The Issue AC cold air _NUMBER_ . At first cold air stopped blowing. Sometimes it would blow but I didn't even turn the ac on. _NUMBER_ . When cold air completely stopped blowing and turned into pure hot air, I tried new Freon. No luck _NUMBER_ . Seemed like it was just the ac heater air was just blowing out but now it gets worse when engine heats up. _NUMBER_ . Brought into shop, was told ac compressor need replaced $ _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ . (no money at the time so I just let it slide) _NUMBER_ . My ac control unit broke, so plastic knobs broke off. Can't control where the hot air gets blown out from. _NUMBER_ . Don't want to sound to picky but I'm pretty broke, so I want to explore my options without spending extra money on things I don't need to get replaced/repaired. My questions >Its been a year since I've tried getting this fixed. So should I try freon again? >I'm not completely sure it was the compressor they told me to fix but I'm confident it was for sure going to be $ _NUMBER_ -$ _NUMBER_ . So Should I bring it into the shop just to make sure? >Obviously I'm going to need a new AC control unit, but perhaps it was that from the beginning. So should I get that replaced first and see if that fixes it? >If I'm completely off and it's something I overlooked, what would it be and how much would it generally cost? PS. Again I'm sorry to have let this problem get this big for so long. I'm back with some money and I want to save this car. It was my grandpa's car and I don't want to sell it at least not for a long time. Big ups on anybody who shares their knowledge/advice. I greatly appreciate it and hope you have a wonderful day.
So I was perusing a fantastic sub today Things that happened exactly _NUMBER_ years ago today when I came across this article about Ford coming up with a brilliant new way of cutting sales costs they'd sell vehicles through repair garages! It immediately brought to mind the conversation we've been having for years with regards to electric vehicles, that dealerships are nothing but repair shops that happen to also sell vehicles. Was this the genesis of dealerships in the US, or am I reading too much into it? That's an honest question, because I don't know enough about the history of dealerships to judge for myself.
I just got my first Harley, _NUMBER_ Sportster Iron _NUMBER_ , with a screaming Eagle _NUMBER_ Kit, Screaming eagle intake, Vance and Hines exhaust, 17K miles. I love this bike, I ve wanted one as long as I can recall, been riding for about _NUMBER_ years, but this is my first Harley. It fucking hauls, I mean it moves fast, under acceleration it runs great, at highway speed it runs great, but it misses when I try to maintain any speed below 50ish, This can't be normal right, I mean I know the Idle is supposed to lope, which i love, but im pretty shure I should be able to cruise and just maintain an even speed in town with a smooth running engine right? If anybody may know why it could be doing this, i would love to hear about it too.
Hi folks, We have now been waiting _NUMBER_ weeks for an engine repair for our _NUMBER_ Elantra. There's a weird ticking happening, and the car will periodically stall on us. Sorry, not overly smart with vehicles, so please entertain my ignorance for the time-being. So, we've been patiently waiting, and my work has been nice enough to allow me to work from home, but now I'm curious about a few things. I'm not sure why this isn't considered a more important issue. We called our dealership today and they've said there are _NUMBER_ others on top of us, waiting for the exact same thing. This is a dealership in our small town of _NUMBER_ people (approx.). Upon looking this issue up, it appears like our model car has the same exact problems as the _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ massive recall. This recall said the car would stall and the engine would do the ticking as well. Now, every time we call the dealership they just keep telling us they'll let us know, but I've been avoiding driving the car as it has stalled a handful of times, so I'm a bit worried to even drive the thing. My main issue is; why haven't we been given a rental? The rep on the phone says it's still under investigation. Okay, I get that, but how long are we to wait? Curious as to why we aren't considering this a more massive problem. The rep we spoke to about a month ago said "well, if I can be honest with you sir: there is a reason why they're on back-order...". To which I understood it as: it's a massive problem. If anyone has any info or similar gripes please let me know what you've done. It appears like they haven't recognized this as a Canada-wide thing at the corporate level, but the dealerships are saying it's a problem. So confused here. If it's this much of a problem, and obviously mirroring the problems of the older models, IMO we shouldn't be driving it at all, but I can't say everyone's issues are the exact same as ours I guess. Could be foolish of me to expect a rental, perhaps, since they said we could drive it, but the reports online seem to steer me in the other direction, as we are worried it may stall again. Anyway, the entire Hyundai experience has been trash for the most part. Really dislike how they seem to operate. If my expectations are too high I can accept that.
I have a _NUMBER_ Audi Q5 with 70k miles on it. I am wondering how urgent it is for me to have my airbags replaced as I just received notice of the recall on the Takata airbags. There has been _NUMBER_ deaths and _NUMBER_ injuries from the faulty airbags. No dealerships in my area have the part or any idea when they will be receiving it. Does anyone have a clue as to how urgent the need for them to be replaced is, or how dangerous it could potentially be as my car is not very old and not in humid conditions.
Currently looking at a _NUMBER_ used TRD Pro w/27k miles for $43k out the door. I'm fully aware that for another $ _NUMBER_ -7k I can buy a new one (if I can find one), but this is a great price for the _NUMBER_ . Looking for thoughts to lead me one way or the other. Is it a terrible decision to pay that for a _NUMBER_ ? Others in my area are $ _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ w/o taxes and fees.
So i bought a _NUMBER_ Tucson and i also bought an apple carplay Apline Radio. I used to install radios but its been a very long time. From what i remember, and from what i found online, the wiring harness is the hardest part so we are set on that. My issue is, everywhere online i look i cannot get an answer on how to remove the dash/stock radio. any help would be great thanks
Hi y'all I have a _NUMBER_ Honda Civic and am wondering if there is some kind of indicator via the Fob that the car has been started when one attempts to remotely start it. I realize the headlights flash but that is only helpful if you can visibly see the car. What if your car is nearby but not immediately visible (such as at work or in the grocery store)? How can you know the car has been successfully started? I had a Viper system on my ' _NUMBER_ Accord and it'd flash green with a positive jingle if it was successful and flash red with a caution sound if it wasn't. Curious if the OEM fob has any sort of indicator like that.
I have been looking for a Canadian dealer for the wheels but can not seem to find anyone. They all have the wheel but in different finishes or not the size I need. I am just looking for them in a Satin Black Finish 17x9 -12mm offset on a 6x5.5 bolt pattern. I just don't want to pay the shipping and such to bring it from the states with the way the dollar is right now, any help would be greatly appreciated thanks!
Hey all Do you think we will ever see the SVT Cobra come back? I am a big fan of the Shelby's, but the old Cobra's still hold a special place in my heart lol my uncle owned a terminator and I was lucky enough to drive it on occasion to class back in high school (was around _NUMBER_ or so if i recall) What are you thoughts on the Cobra models and do you think it will see a return later down the road?
With the proliferation of electric vehicles, not everyone that buys one will have a garage. Have any of you seen any good stealthy charging stations for the curbside? The tesla wall charger is fine in a garage, but not curbside to a _NUMBER_ craftsman house. Do any of you have experience building one?
I test drove a (new this week) Model X P100D today. The test drive was amazing. After pulling back into the garage the owner advisor showed me the frunk and trunk then we walked away from the car. He then surprised me by activating summon from his pocket. The car was coming straight for the side of the garage door opening but he let it continue (I assume to show me how it will adjust). The car kept going, and then hit the opening pretty hard. It crunched and we both let out a huge sigh. He then let me away to talk about the car some more and brushed it off. I left the store very pained from what I had just seen. Poor Model X. Has anybody else had this kind of experience? Do the sensors have problems like this often? What will Tesla do with this car?
I own a _NUMBER_ dodge Dakota, _NUMBER_ liter v8 magnum quad cab, _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ size bed. Well, on my dashboard it has a 4x4 light on my dashboard, but its 2wd. The light is not on though. It doesn't have a transfer case in the truck, and whenever I have the vin number ran, it comes up 4x4. It was told to me that it was just 2wd. It doesn't have a transfer case, and it has a 4lo indicator on my dashboard. Is it 4x4?
The independent inspection is on Monday, and if it's all clear, I have Thursday off work to take the train down to Essex to pick it up. 38k miles, Luxury trim (I prefer the softer suspension to the M sport. Adaptive would be best of course but I have got a great price on this car), with pro nav, heated seats, and a few other extras. Does anyone have any advice on anything specific to look out for on this car? I have owned a 330ci and an e60 530i. I will of course do the usual checks on wear components (although the RAC inspection should flag up anything awry). I really love how much of a sleeper this car is. Deleted badges, luxury trim only the twin exhausts give away the > _NUMBER_ bhp. I'm very excited! _URL_
I have an ' _NUMBER_ XL1200C. It has screamin' eagle slip ons and an S&S air cleaner on it from the previous owner; looking online, I'm pretty sure it's the S&S Super E setup. I ordered V&H short shots, but haven't put them on yet since I know the intake and exhaust play off of one another. Am I good to go as long as I tune the carbs after I change the exhaust, or do I need to look into a different air cleaner as well? I've got a mechanical background, but not much in the way of carbureted setups. Any input is much appreciated. Thanks all.
currently right now stock with cosmetic mods, jeeps just a toy, driven maybe once to three times a week. june 6th im getting lifted _NUMBER_ " my issue is regarding tire size and height. my housing situation changed over the last year and now i need to be able to fit in a _NUMBER_ ' _NUMBER_ " garage.. does anyone have trouble witha common parking garage ? i have my beadlocks and lift payed for... so the real question comes down to can i run 37s ? would anyone be willing to measure there jeeps height? i can easily go down to 35s. but need to be able to fit regardless. any help is appreciated!!
So as my previous post says, I'm looking to put a _NUMBER_ " lift with 35s on my _NUMBER_ JK. However, some people say that a _NUMBER_ " coil lift could ride at _NUMBER_ " with stock equipment (bumper, no winch, etc). I'm looking at this lift, on a stock equipment _NUMBER_ -door JK. My question is will this ride above _NUMBER_ ", and if so, should I get a budget boost instead?
So after finally popping my diff covers off to check out the gears, I descovered I have stock open d35s, no limited slip, nothing cool at all, and the gears were in pretty rough shape. I have a _NUMBER_ " long arm kit sitting on 33s so its only a matter of time before this fucker snaps on me. Tldr: is it worth throwing a super d35 _NUMBER_ spline kit in there or is that just pollishing a turd? If not, then what should i replace it with and how can i do it on a budget if possible? Thanks in advance.
So I've been driving my ' _NUMBER_ everyday for a little over a year now and I've realized it needs some more power. I've considered a V8 swap but for right now that's too much of a project. I've also considered doing a turbo or a supercharger but can't find kits anywhere and don't have the knowledge to do it without a kit. I also don't know if I need to rebuild the engine with stronger internals if I want to add some boost to the car. I'm open to any suggestions to add power i just want my car to be a little more powerful for some more fun.
Ok, so I have a pretty good idea what you all will say, but still want to ask. I currently drive an APR stage _NUMBER_ GTI (DSG because my wife can't drive stick, for now). But I want to get out of a car payment since I like to modify my car. So I've found a _NUMBER_ Civic Si coupe and a _NUMBER_ BR-Z, both around the same price and miles, both have exhaust and suspension mods done, and that's it. I'd like to go forced induction in a year or so since I'll be taking such a step back from my GTI. So, what do you all think? I love the way they both look, and obviously RWD is way more fun, but is there anything I'm not thinking about? Also will it be easier to make power with one over the other? Thanks for your help!
As the title says, and I am not sure if i should be posting in /r/legaladvice or elsewhere, but I thought if anyone else was hit on their motorcycle, it be nice to get advice. I (31M) was in an accident about _NUMBER_ months ago. Someone changed lanes into me on the freeway. Luckily we were in traffic and I was only going around _NUMBER_ mph when we slammed together, but I broke my leg, severely bruised my ribs, my hand was banged up and my foot completely crushed. It was deemed their fault and the insurance company will take care of all the bills, but i need to deal with a settlement for the time i missed for work as well as pain and suffering and any medical bills i will incur as i get older is more issues come up with my ribs/leg/foot/hand. Should i hire a lawyer or just handle myself? I don't want to pay a lawyer but i know they can get more money so it evens out. Anyone been through this before? Also, how much info should i give the other insurance company? Do they need my SSN? Thanks! Ride safe out there and always wear the right equipment, i know i wish i was wearing my riding boots over just leather boots. I'd be running by now.
I'm thinking of getting my first Audi ever, and I'm looking at a _NUMBER_ S3 @ 27k miles for $27k. Is this a good price? I also drive around _NUMBER_ -30k miles a year and am planning on getting a stage _NUMBER_ tune, switching to stage _NUMBER_ after the 130k CarMax warranty is up. Is this a bad idea?
I understand with an X-pipe you get VERY SLIGHTLY more HP and TQ, but I honestly think the H-pipe is better suited in a muscle car for sound. I am torn between the two, I kinda like the X-pipe sound, but I feel like it just doesn't suit a muscle car. It's raspiness just doesn't "feel" right on a muscle car. Now, the stock H-pipe, I love the deep sound it makes, but it's not as loud or "violent" sounding, but it has that nice classic "muscle sound" Your thoughts?
Hi everyone. A little back story. About a year ago I bought a _NUMBER_ A5 S line manual with 60k miles for 20k$. I had to finance for most of it. I dont carry any credit card debt, don't have kids, and work a decent job. I had the car inspected before I purchased it and all was well except the tires. Fast forward to now and Ive replaced the motor mounts and replaced the drivers window regulator. The failing clutch switch has killed the cruise control, the washer fluid is now leaking, the blower motor works when it wants, and I believe the differential mounts are starting to go. On the upside, oil consumption is good, clutch seems fine, no other leaks, and it's in great shape. I knew that maintenance and repairs were going to be more than say a Japanese car, but Im getting nearvous that Im sitting on a time bomb. Should I stick with my investment or get out while I can? Thanks for any advice from other Audi owners.
As S and X continues to be improved I could see the getting the new feature of the air vent like the one of the model _NUMBER_ . The new vents should be a lot quieter than normal due to less disturbance in airflow and bigger cross-section of Area of the "vent-hole" What do you guys think, and if so when can we expect it?
Hey guys! Just convinced my mom (only _NUMBER_ ) to get a Model S. She's going on a test drive on the 22nd. In the email it lets you design it all yourself, We obviously want the autopilot and auto lane change (my mom tends to get very sick and is to tired to drive and get soda and I can't drive :/) but what else is really worth the money here?
I am looking to purchase a _NUMBER_ + up VW. I used to own a MK4 Jetta _NUMBER_ .8t and really loved that car. My brother bought a _NUMBER_ GLI and he has nothing bad to say about the car. I also drove it and it feels really nice. The clutch is smooth and it's got some power. I was originally planning to purchase a MK7 GTI but after some reviewing of my finances, it may not be the best choice right now (unless I wait until next year to save for a bigger down payment. I've listed my options below (sorry for the poor formatting). MK6 GTI (manual _NUMBER_ door) or MK6 GLI (manual, preferably _NUMBER_ version with that extra _NUMBER_ HP). I have hot hatch fever, and everyone says the MK7 GTI is far superior than the MK6. Do I wait it out?
I got under my NG900 this afternoon to investigate a clunking sound going over bumps or poor roads. I figured it was suspension related but everything seemed in order. The only thing I could find was what looked to be a severely worn right-hand side engine mount. The oil pan is almost resting on the subframe. Could this be the culprit?
Hello again everyone, I really appreciate the positive feedback and willingness to help someone who wants to get into an EV, so thanks a lot! I have a few additional questions that have come up since the last post. _NUMBER_ ) Does anyone have their volt exclusively outside? I live in South Dakota, and it gets rather cold for about _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ months and I am worried about the battery being damaged/not starting. _NUMBER_ ) Tailing off the last bit, how does the Volt handle snow/ice? I can't really find any input on that factor on Youtube or anything. _NUMBER_ ) I will be staying with my uncle for the next two years, and I want to make sure I am paying for the electricity I use to charge the Volt. Is there any way I can keep track of how many KWh I put into the vehicle? Once again, I am astonished at how willing you all are all to help someone who may be a little cautious in making such a big decision. I appreciate it more than you could ever know!
I'm having trouble removing the starter on my _NUMBER_ SR5. I can't reach the bottom mounting bolt with my wrenches because there are brake lines in the way, and I don't have the equipment to do a proper flush at home. The original starter just went out at 220K and I'm having a hell of a time with it. I can't really access it from underneath without doing some mechanic yoga, but I think I can work with it if anyone has any advice for tool/arm/hand positioning. I've been doing the whole diesel thing, so I haven't worked in the tight spaces this truck has in a bit. But really, any advice is good advice. Thanks!
If you're a frequent reader of this subreddit, you would have come across my question on how to figure out the actual average market value for a Porsche, which I had posted sometime ago. I was satisfied with the inputs I received but I knew there was room for something more. Well, one thought led to another and I decided that there's need to be a price guide that reflects the market price across all platforms on the internet. My process? Visit communities, classfied websites and more to find out the price range of the model and calculate the mean value for that model (A lot of excel numbers. A lot!). This should give the reader an *idea* (at the very least) of what he should be paying for the model. Here's a link to the guide: _URL_ Please leave your feedback on it. Thanks!
Hey everyone. I just found a steal on an _NUMBER_ Wrx and everything looked perfect and it only had one owner! The only thing is that it has an after market air intake. Does it need a special tune or something? If I buy this car what's the first thing I should do to make sure it works perfectly? Should I get it tuned? Please help haha I'm new to the Subaru game.
We took our new RGU on our first ride today after riding it home from the dealership last Sunday. We rode with our whole group of friends from Chesapeake to Nags Head for lunch. On the way home I got a flat tire. I have Geico insurance with road side assistance and they said that none of the tow companies they called would drive out of town to get us. It was getting dark and my friends hung out with us while one of them rode home and got their truck and trailer and came and picked us up. We're very fortunate/blessed to have such a great group of friends. _NUMBER_ Road Glide Ultra
Additional information: Honda Accord _NUMBER_ V6 Full option: The car is _NUMBER_ years old, 36k in mileage (it's true), still has two years warranty until _NUMBER_ on the main parts (AC, Engine, etc.) Price is _NUMBER_ % cheaper than new. I really like it and it looks amazing. I also didn't notice the damages, but I have to say I'm not a professional. I'm going also to keep it for at least _NUMBER_ years. Should I buy? Thank you
Does anyone know if the Volts made in the USA and for the USA market can be imported to Canada and registered without any adjustments? I know that this is not always the case with every car model. The regulations are somewhat different. I'm in particular interested in a _NUMBER_ or _NUMBER_ Volt Premier. Thoughts?
I am looking at buying one of the following: _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ E350 RWD Sedan _NUMBER_ -liter Direct Injection gasoline V- _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ hp @ _NUMBER_ rpm _NUMBER_ lb-ft torque @ _NUMBER_ – _NUMBER_ rpm or _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ E400 RWD Sedan. _NUMBER_ -liter biturbo Direct Injection gasoline V- _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ hp @ _NUMBER_ – _NUMBER_ rpm _NUMBER_ lb-ft torque @ _NUMBER_ – _NUMBER_ rpm The E400 would cost a bit more, but it has more power and a lot more torque. Any suggestions to go one way or the other? I've seen E350s with < _NUMBER_ miles for around low $ _NUMBER_ ,000s. E400s for around high $ _NUMBER_ ,000s. I am in California btw.
The rear power shade on my c140 coupe is broken. I've rebuilt it previously with aftermarket reproduction gears but it's broken again as the non-mb gears are terrible quality. Can I buy a used unit from a w210, w140, or even c class? These cars have the same style of sunshade, but I don't know if they are the same dimensions.
Title is pretty straight forward looking at these Slip-Ons: bombers slash cut and these headers: Powerflex headers for touring Just wanting to understand if this eliminates the catalytic converter and if the sound will be a deep rumble and how it would compare to a full V&H setup. Planning to pair this with a big sucker and FP3 tune. On mobile, so sorry for any formatting issues. Used search, but didn't see anything recent on the slip on exhaust and no comments regarding the header. Thanks in advance!
Anyone have any experience with flywheel conversions? I have a _NUMBER_ Rabbit with 166kms on it that I bought used and I'm not wanting to spend a ton of money on (it's getting rough). My ' _NUMBER_ TDI DMF bailed hard on me, so I would like to convert this one. I'm looking at the Valeo and the Sachs kits _URL_ _URL_ The Sachs is cheaper, but it's not listed as a conversion. Are either of these a safe bet?
Hey everyone! So, I'm in a place where they're finally building a Tesla store (it's been too long if you ask me!), and it'll be the first full store in my state, though they've had a couple of pop up stores here and there (I'm in Australia, so not as many stores here unfortunately :P!) Obviously, with the new store they're looking for more employees, and I'm about to submit an application as a Product Specialist since working for Tesla would be my absolute dream job. I just had a question to all the other employees out there how does Tesla rank in terms of 'likeability' I guess? Do you guys enjoy what you do, how much pressure is there to sell (coming from _NUMBER_ + years of KPI jobs, I've seen a lot of times when people force a sale and people end up with buyer's regret and I hate it when people are forced into that to keep their job), what's the best part of the job and all that?! Just all the general experiences about working at Tesla :) Sorry if this isn't a post that's allowed, but I'm really curious as to what it's like to work at Tesla, and hopefully I'll get the job here and can update my own experiences soon :D!
Got some bfg ko2s recently from Northridge 4x4. _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ /r17 is the tire size and the wheels are 17x9 with _NUMBER_ " backspacing. Took some pics of them that I tried to find online and only found a handful so if anyone is considering them feel free to ask questions. _URL_
I own a _NUMBER_ mustang Gt.Here recently i noticed my alternator gauge dancing esp when my ac is on.I tested it at work it was a bad voltage regulator so i replaced the alternator when i test drove it my gauges went nuts.I replaced it and the new tested fine a week later, sitting in my driveway the alt gauge started dancing again.Then the car died like it was out of gas.so eather the alternator is bad again causing my fuel gauge to read wrong. I have replaced the fuel pump _NUMBER_ times.Replaced the ECM and now the car is doing the same thing it has.any ideas?
I seriously doubt the timing of the high mileage CPO is accidental, but it seems like interesting timing to me so I've been trying to think through what the motivation would be for adding all these lower cost Model S CPOs a month before production is supposed to start for the Model _NUMBER_ . Here's some thoughts. _NUMBER_ ) Someone suggested they may expect the value of their pre-owned inventory to depreciate significantly with the release of model _NUMBER_ so they're trying to cash out while they can. If true, that would actually make these CPOs not a good buy right now. But they didn't previously sell use cars with such high mileage right? If they were aggressively cutting the prices on the lower mileage pre-owneds that would indicate a cash-out but I'm not sure here as I think this is a totally new category. _NUMBER_ ) It's possible the sales have slowed as people are waiting for the Model _NUMBER_ and this is a way for them to drive some extra revenue without doing any major pivots in the company. In fact, if they're already preparing to have to do extra service on the increasing fleet of Model 3s on the road, doing some refurbish work on the used cars could be a good way to keep the increased workforce for that busy as they build up to capacity and during any downtime. _NUMBER_ ) Also assuming sales may be slower this quarter (not actually sure if that's true or not), selling as many CPOs as they can this month would help boost their financials a bit before the quarter ends. Wouldn't help with delivery targets for new cars, but would increase revenue. _NUMBER_ ) Even if they achieve what would under any other circumstances be considered a good and smooth ramp-up to full scale production, there is *no way* they are going to live up to some of the expectations out there. This help alleviate some of that pressure by giving some of those waiting to spend ~$35k on a car a faster way into a Tesla and again boosting revenue a bit moving forward regardless of how production ramps up. I hope that's not their primary motivation as I doubt it will make that much of an impact in that regard. _NUMBER_ ) They're offering a *taste* of the more premium car. Sort of like the idea of giving a P100D loaner while your car is being repaired with the hopes that you'll love it and buy a higher end car next time, this could be a bit of a gateway to move would-be Model _NUMBER_ owners into Model S owners and eventually get them to buy newer cars from them. _NUMBER_ ) Sort of the opposite of # _NUMBER_ , but they may be expecting a large influx of people moving from the older Model S to a new Model _NUMBER_ and wanting to trade in those high mileage cars now they have a program in place to resell those when the time comes. Any other thoughts on why they would have timed the high mileage CPO program like this? I'm fascinated with trying to think through why they do things how and when they do them.
I'm looking to buy a decent cheap car, and pickings are very slim in my area. I came across this Civic here: _URL_ and I'm going to go and see it tonight. It's the only post- _NUMBER_ Honda I've seen for such a low price here, but the kms are much higher than I was hoping. I'd really like to get at least _NUMBER_ more years out of it without any major expensive repairs (like engine replacement). Daily I'd be driving it 30km, and occasionally in the summer (think once a weekend or every other weekend) it will be taken on 200km to 800km (this long of a trip will probably be once a summer only) round trips. If everything checks out when I see it, and everything looks good on the Carfax report, should I get this car?
Happy Saturday boys and girls. Just left car wash and epc light came on and power was down on car. Just got home and turned engine off and on and light has gone off. Any ideas? Car recently went in for some semi major repairs but was driving like a dream since I got her back until this happened.
So I'm currently thinking of deleting my muffler and resonator on my _NUMBER_ ecoboost mustang. I've looked at videos online and they sound pretty good in my opinion but I have yet to hear one in person. Have any of you done this or heard a car that has this done? If so how did it sound?
I don't know much about 4Runners, and am looking at getting one for my 1st Toyota. I'm reading as much as possible about them and this one has been recently offered where I live. Is this a good deal or should I keep looking? My budget is $ _NUMBER_ . Thanks!
I have a 50lb german shepherd puppy, who will grow to 100lbs easily enough in the next year or so. My lease on my fusion is about up and i am looking to get a sporty car to replace it with. I like the new mustang GTs and am thinking about getting one, however i need to be able to put Zelda in the back seat. Is there enough room back there for her? Would she be able to fit behind the seat to get in? Here is a picture of her right now she is pretty big and will probably grow another _NUMBER_ % _URL_
Hey everyone. Quick question. I'm relatively new to 4wd vehicles. My 97runner light would turn on in the late summer when I engaged 4wd, but lately it has not. Does this mean it is not engaging? or possible that the light is out somehow? I'm looking for any methods to check that it is in fact engaging? Thanks
Decided to do a very long print, and over night print. Waited for it to finish the raft and start printing the actual project, then went to sleep. Woke up to Cthulhu. I will try to add as much info as possible to try and determine what went wrong. As it stands I was finally able to clear out enough filament to pull the heating element out of its carriage, there is melted filament underneath the tape/fiberglass wrap and in the cable tubes. Is this un-fixable? Let me know if you all need more info. _URL_
Hey guys, my girlfriend has had this super sweet _NUMBER_ 4x4 _NUMBER_ speed sitting in her backyard for years now. It used to belong to her mom, but her mom neglected it and now drives a sedan. From what I know there's no major issue with it, aside from just being sitting there for years. The tires are basically disintegrated , my girlfriend says the oil is really gunky and muddy, but that's as much as me and her both know. Our plan is to start restoring it this summer so I've come to ask for help or advice , any pointers. My main question is where should we start? I'm not unfamiliar with cars, I daily an Acura rsx type s _NUMBER_ speed and when I bought it , it wouldn't start. The axles needed replacing and then followed the tie rods and ball joints, but I knew the problem from the start because the previous owner told me. However, I don't know if there's anything wrong with this 4Runner ( or how to find out if there is) and I'm clueless on where to start. Any help or advice is appreciated. TL;DR trying to make a _NUMBER_ 4x4 run again , don't know where to start
Hi all, I am a happy and proud owner of _NUMBER_ S40 _NUMBER_ Momentum. It is still in mint condition but I am thinking for some relatively minor (but maybe useful) upgrades. So: _NUMBER_ ) I always thought that the side mirrors are quite small. A friend of mine has the face lifted version ( _NUMBER_ ) and the mirrors are considerably larger. Is it easy to replace my cars' mirrors with the updated ones? _NUMBER_ ) Has anyone modded their s40 ( _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ ) to make it a _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ model? The car is basically the same except some minor touches here and there. You know, bumpers-headlamps, rear light cluster and bumper as well as a new wide spaced boot-lid Volvo logo. (interior is essentially the same except some knobs) . Is it easy cheap to do it or are there any misfits here and there? Thank you in advance.
...and I came across my _NUMBER_ Toyota 4Runner that I used to own, back around _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ . It was the SR5 V6 2WD automatic. It was my 3rd car I had owned, and still to this day the only automatic vehicle I've ever had. It had a few niggles, like the idle speed that needed almost constant adjustment, bad mpg, slow acceleration, below average leg room in the 2nd row, and a motorized antenna mechanism that needed replacing because of the plastic teeth that wore out (stupid _NUMBER_ 's things lol). BUT, it had some definite positives. Great styling inside and out (I still love the way the 2nd gens look), great build quality on the interior, surprisingly good off-road capability for 2WD, especially after upgrading to _NUMBER_ " BFGoodrich All-Terrains, a smooth V6 with a fantastic stock exhaust note, good visibility with lots of glass everywhere and thin A-pillars, an electric sliding tailgate window, comfortable seats, an amazing amount of space in the rear cargo area (trade off for mediocre 2nd row legroom), an excellent ride thanks to great stock suspension tuning, and a stupid-good resale value. So yeah, I just wanted to share the love I had for my old and somewhat forgotten Toyota 4Runner. Anyone else miss their 2nd gen 4Runners? I wanted to do a crosspost, but I don't subscribe.
Merry Christmas Porsche fans My dad has always wanted a _NUMBER_ and is ready to begin looking. He has a 40k budget, maybe slightly more, and wants a _NUMBER_ model. I'm trying to push him towards a Cayman S but he's stuck on a _NUMBER_ which is perfectly fine. He's says the first few years of _NUMBER_ are in his price range What should we watch out for on these early models? He says he doesn't care if it manual or not but I'm pushing him to manual. When did PDK start? Once we narrow down to years and exact model I'll likely look on Rennlist or other forums for a well cared for example. Lastly should I steer him to a cayman s so he can get a newer model? Thanks all
Rear passenger window recently dropped into the door when closing it on a cold day. I pulled of the trim and stuck a 2x4 in there to keep the window up for now, and just got the little repair kit in the mail. I watched the repair video from Taliaferro and it shows the regulator removed from the car, but according to WIS in order to remove the rear window regulator I need to drill out rivets. I really don't want to bother with that. Does anyone know if the broken plastic piece can be replaced in situ? Or is there another way to remove the regulator? I'd just like to avoid buying a rivet gun I will likely rarely use just to fix this
' _NUMBER_ Jeep Cherokee Sport feels like one pothole away from a Micheal Bay style explosion. Really a shame, had her since High School, been all through America with it, and just got over 160k miles. However, keeping almost all her stock parts running since the start, her pure-bred prone issues are starting to show (crack cylinder head, thank you casting _NUMBER_ !). So as one friendship ends, another one shall begin. I'm starting to look at trucks to buy for my next vehicle, relatively soon, but don't have much knowledge about them. I have some mechanic ability and knowledge, mostly inhibited by a lack of tools for the bigger jobs. However, if you haven't picked up on it already, I'm looking for something used but reliable. Something with some love and care can go strong for years to come. Don't need too much hauling power, I won't be hauling anything bigger than a bed full of logs or a small boat trailer. The other things I am looking for in a truck include... * Two Door, something on the mid-smaller size range * _NUMBER_ -cylinder, 4WD * Obviously reliability * Probably going to end up lifting it, and other alterations, so easy to customize (or readily available parts) * Under $ _NUMBER_ Any suggestions or advice would be GREATLY appreciated, thank you for your time!
Hey guys, Sadly, my Mazda2 didn't survive its run-in with a deer. I am looking to move up to a used Mazda3, but having trouble deciding which I should go for. I have narrowed it down, but would like to know your thoughts: _NUMBER_ . _NUMBER_ Mazda3 base model, manual, _NUMBER_ miles $ _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ . _NUMBER_ Mazda3 sport model, automatic, _NUMBER_ miles $ _NUMBER_ Most of the other features are the same or negligible to me, the big issue is the _NUMBER_ has no cruise control, and would cost ~$ _NUMBER_ to add on from what I can gather. Would you rather go for the newer car or the car with less miles? Manual is also tempting to me but cruise control is a must. Thanks for reading and helping me out.
I found a _NUMBER_ WRX wagon with 11k original miles, I'll let you guys read the description of the car and tell me if you think its worth the purchase. I want to talk him down close to 8k for the rebuilt title. _URL_ My problem is insurance and stability in the future. I would already be spending _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ of my spending money purchasing this car, so I'm wondering how long I should have on it till something starts going. I have _NUMBER_ accidents under my belt for being _NUMBER_ , almost _NUMBER_ . One when I was _NUMBER_ or _NUMBER_ , the other was just last year when I was _NUMBER_ . I would like to purchase a lesser plan as I wont be using this as a daily to school, only for work on the weekends ( _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ days a week; _NUMBER_ miles each way). In the future I would like to mod it, catback, accessport, airfilter, possible BOV. But that comes with time.
Hey all, About _NUMBER_ months ago I leased a Passat R-line from a local dealer. Got a great deal for a _NUMBER_ month lease. However, I have secured a new job with quite the increase in pay ( _NUMBER_ % more) and would love to get into a new A3 or S3- I love that platform and miss the luxuries of Audi that my Passat just doesn't have. Is this feasible with VW? I spoke to someone and they sounded dismissive of the idea, so I'm looking for other opinions (not personal finance help, just if the VWAG allows this) Thanks!
Hey y'all, I've been eyeing some 4Runners in my area to buy. I've been a Jeep guy since the beginning and I'm ready to have a car that'll last me a long time. My biggest priority is longevity of this car's life. So here's my question: Do y'all think it's smarter to get a 4th Gen with around _NUMBER_ -120k miles and save a good amount of money from it, or to shell out the cash and go after a 5th Gen that has _NUMBER_ -100k miles? Based on my financial situation, I'm able to pay up to $12k upfront. I can do a $ _NUMBER_ -8k loan too (for the 5th gens). I don't have a preference of body style necessarily. I just wanted some 3rd party advice from the experts and see what y'all have to say! Sorry about the long post, and thank you in advance!
Hey guys, I was removing the bowden tube to fix a jam today and the threaded part of the metal connector that goes attaches to blue part of the tube broke off. Is there a 3d printable part that I could print to fix this or should I order another metal connector piece. This is next to the extruder motor on the top of the machine. Thanks.
Hey guys this is my first 3d printer that ive had for a couple of days now. It worked great but i think that I have a pretty big jam. i removed the brass piece connected to the bowden tube and there is filament jammed all the way to the brass piece. I tried heating it up and pushing the filament down but nothing will come out. Any advice or what to do next?
Hello /lexus, So I've had my IS300 for about a year now and I think it's time for a little bit of an upgrade. I've always loved the 2IS and I don't think I can leave the IS line just yet. Don't really have much to spend (about 10k) since I won't be financing but here's my questions for everyone. What is the best in terms of years for IS250 to buy? I know 2007s had their carbon and ring issues, is this a problem for all of the 2nd gen _NUMBER_ ? That being said is it worth it for me to just keep my IS300 and then save up more money for a newer 2IS due to these engine issues? I know you guys just want to recommend the IS350 to me and I would love to get one but there's honestly no point for me right now. I don't need the power and coming from an IS300, a _NUMBER_ will be very similar and I'm perfectly fine with that. 350s are easily $3k more in my area. RWD or AWD doesn't matter, I know about snow tires and how to drive in the snow. IS250 RWDs aren't that popular anyways. TL;DR: I want an IS250, but is it worth it to get rid of my IS300 if all of them are going to have carbon/engine issues?
Hey guys! I'm a first time poster but a long time reader. I am pre approved with my bank and I wanted to know if an ambassador would be able to share a coupon? This will be my first Subaru and car purchase and I am so pumped! If anyone in the Sub family can help it will be so appreciated. I'm thinking of a WRX or a Forester XT
I am looking to get into a _NUMBER_ Turbo Coupe in the next year or so. I am seeing prices in the mid-to-high $ _NUMBER_ 's for higher mileage ' _NUMBER_ Turbos (70k+) and clean examples with under 50k miles in the mid-$60k range. Is there a consensus on bottom-end depreciation for these models? Does anyone anticipate appreciation down the line?
Hi all, Was wondering if any model x owners notice a large discrepency with what their battery states their available miles are available to drive vs actual driven miles. A friend of mine who owns an S said she has been using an X while hers in in the shop and stated that her X is using almost double the amount of miles per her battery than actually being driven. IE she travels _NUMBER_ miles but it's using _NUMBER_ miles of battery life. She says she does not have this problem with her S. Thanks for your thoughts and experience!
how much of a no-no are 20s on the steel springs? (it's an E200D Exclusive/Luxury) I was going to go with the 20s (multispoke) from the S class..... but is the ride completely ruined? (I don't want AMG rims as I'm going with a luxury look). I don't want to go for the air suspension as its a 4k option nearly and I'll be owning it and if it's anything like the airmatic then it'll be in the shop more than it's on the road
This might be a total misuse of this subreddit, if so, I'm sorry! But is anyone in the UK selling or know where to get new W204 wheels? I'm on the standard _NUMBER_ ' but they look incredibly tired. I'm trying to source a fresh look for them, _NUMBER_ inchers as a minimum! Thanks!
I got my Saab _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ about a month ago and since I got it the radio and blinkers have not worked. I looked online and found it had something to do with the amp1, so long story short I went to my local junkyard bought one for $ _NUMBER_ and plugged it in and everything works good. My question is how does the Amp1 break on so many cars? What can I do to give this one a longer life span?
I drove past a fellow _NUMBER_ owner today and they gave a good wave, and I responded with a honk. So to the owner of the white _NUMBER_ wagon; I dunno if you browse this subreddit bud, but you really turned my poop day into a good one. Also your car is great. Obligatory picture of my baby. (Sorry for bad quality, all I have is old iPod.)
Nothing wrong with it, it was bought at an auction by a friend and his dad. It was a school resource vehicle, one that our local schools officer used to go back and forth to the school. Nothing wrong with it so far that I can see, how should I go about this? thanks
Hi guys, im contemplating about buying a used model s either _NUMBER_ or _NUMBER_ but im noticing a difference in headlights. Can anyone tell me more about the differences? The old one really looks like christmas lights, but when looking online in occasions, i cant really figure out what model has those lights. Please see this link for the difference: _URL_
I got a _NUMBER_ jeep wrangler sahara, since day one my built in nav has not worked. I get cannot unlock maps error. I googled it, someone said to get sirius sub and try it. So i did, and still nothing. I went to the website and updated firmware and still nothing. Then the dealer website asked me to pay _NUMBER_ $ plus _NUMBER_ $ shipping for a sd card with the maps in order to get it unlocked. Why the fuck did i pay _NUMBER_ $ for the navi package that i have to pay another _NUMBER_ $ just to use?? Is their a was around this?
My _NUMBER_ RX300 with 227K miles likes to shudder sometimes between 3rd gear shifting down to 4th (overdrive). Sometimes it is worse than others, I can't quite tell if certain throttle positions make it worse, but it is starting to aggrevate me. Not sure it is getting worse, but it has been happening for over a year. I changed the fluid using a drain/fill method about _NUMBER_ years ago. I used to think it happened more with a light throttle input than medium or high throttle position, or that it happened at certain speeds, but to be honest I haven't really noticed a pattern as of late, aside from the fact that it does it way more often that I would like...It is the AWD model. &nbsp; FWIW I had the transmission fully rebuilt about 60K miles ago. I also have the transmission intercooler, which is interesting considering I don't have a tow hitch installed. Maybe transmission cooler is aftermarket, I can't exactly tell...I have never done a full transmission fluid flush. &nbsp; Question _NUMBER_ ) Is there a solenoid responsible for this shift that I can replace? Question _NUMBER_ ) Do you think a passageway in the transmission pathways could be clogged and causing this issue? Question _NUMBER_ ) Is there any chance a bad electrical connection is causing this? Question _NUMBER_ ) Is this related to transmission problems this tranny/engine/vehicle combo is known for? Question _NUMBER_ ) What would you do in my situation? &nbsp; I am willing to drop the tranny pan and look around, but I use this car regularly and having it down for weeks isn't really a great option. I also don't work FT at the moment, so I'm not exactly trying to spend $ _NUMBER_ + at a repair shop for them to do something I can do in an afternoon. &nbsp; Thank you in advance for your advice!
I'm a potentially interested in getting a Chevy Volt, but the price out of the gate is way too high for me. I've been looking at used prices on autotrader, and it's a bit shocking. Why is the Volt dropping like $20k in two years? Is it a model change? Is it all battery? Is this just how non-econocars depreciate? What's going on?
(I tried to post this in /r/cars, but it was removed for some reason. I'm not in the market for a new Subaru right now, our Forester is awesome. I just like new cars and knowing about them. Maybe you all would be more interested!) I've been unsure about this for a while, so I've done some research: what are the distinct differences between the Impreza hatchback and the Crosstrek, and what makes one better than the other, or more suited to certain situations? I've found out a lot, but I'm sure I'm missing things as well. Here are the pros that I've found for each. _TAG_ _NUMBER_ -door * **Lower price.** The Impreza _NUMBER_ -door starts almost $ _NUMBER_ cheaper than the Crosstrek. * **Better fuel economy.** In particular, highway mileage is better. * **Interior materials.** This is a pro for both sides, because it's really personal preference, but some materials used on the Impreza are softer. * **Nicer driving experience.** This is subjective, of course, but being lower to the ground would make the Impreza a bit more nimble on average. If only the engine and manual transmission were better. _TAG_ * **Increased ride height.** This contributes mainly to a bit better all-weather and off-road capability, but some folks just like sitting higher up too. * **Plastic body cladding.** It looks more like a crossover, which people seem to like these days. * **Interior materials.** Again, personal preference; the Crosstrek uses some materials that are more rugged and easier to clean. * **Extra off-road capability.** This includes X-mode, which optimizes torque distribution for low-speed traction when you need it, and Hill Descent Control, which does similar stuff when going downhill. * **Better manual transmission.** This is a big deal for me. The _NUMBER_ Crosstrek got a much better _NUMBER_ -speed manual (like the Forester), while the Impreza still has the crappier _NUMBER_ -speed. It's not just the extra gear that matters. The Impreza shifter just feels very imprecise. * **Towing.** Official tow rating of _NUMBER_ lbs, while the Impreza is not tow rated. Thanks to /u/guiltydoggy and /u/mevildaygo! Those are all of the differences I can find. Can anyone else think of any? Or do you have an unrelated reason to pick one over the other? By the way, if either car would adopt an engine that's quicker and more torque-y than the NA _NUMBER_ .0L, that would give it huge bonus points in my book. **Edit:** Added "towing" to Crosstrek list.
im a first time Subaru owner and just recently purchased a ( _NUMBER_ Jap) _NUMBER_ B4 GT(EJ20) 4AT (the car is Japanese, and purchased here in Japan) Some things i've noticed while driving it around are that it sounds like it needs to shift higher while in drive but the RPMs are relatively low. Also when i come to a stop it will drop RPMs and seem like its going to stall out, but will recover. I'm planning on looking at vacuum lines and also cleaning my intake sensors as soon as i can. Anyone else have a similar issue, or other solutions? The car is still under warranty so if need be ill take it back. Just looking for some fixes that will prevent me from being car-less. Thank you.
Hi all, I recently got a new headlight assembly for a car. The brand is "Eagle Eyes". They're CAPA certified if that means anything to anyone. I'll post before and after pics after I detail the car. They look stellar. I paid (like a fool ) to have them installed. It was daytime when I picked it up and thought all was well. Well tonight during my drive home, I'm seeing that the light doesn't gently spread and diffuse out. It ends in a jagged line like 8ft in front of the car. It's very weird. Looking at the headlights they look normal, but from inside the car they are atrocious and I'm upset I paid so many shame dollars for goofed up headlights. Is there anything I can do here at home to adjust them at all? Or should I go back to the shop and start knocking stuff over and threatening a lawsuit (kidding)? Thanks y'all :)
Im trying to move to a different apartment and many places tell me I cant plug into the wall sockets not because it costs money but because having extension cords or permanent fixtures plugged into the wall all the time is not upto code. (Im in minnesota and my current place has said it fine). I've explained time and time again its not a cable its a ul listed appliance and I take it with me when its not in use making it a portable device. Surely GM wouldn't sell a charger if it violated fire code right? Is this the best way to keep approaching this? Im sad I might have to move and sell her shortly after if I cant plug her in at night.
Hey guys. Many of you guys know that Tesla is now charging for the use of superchargers. I've been learning to do a bit of web development and created a calculator very similar to what Ben Sullins did as a side project. I did add a few things though, namely it allows you to select your Model S version and also has a few fields to calculate the cost for an ICE car to travel the same amount of miles. Check it out and let me know what you think and whether or not it's useful. Cheers! P.S. Sorry, it doesn't work very well on mobile. _URL_
This past Friday I got an oil change for my Gen _NUMBER_ HB. The old oil was a jiffy lube conventional/synthetic blend which was the cheapest option they told me about when I had it put in this summer. On Friday, they had an option for straight conventional oil for about $ _NUMBER_ less than the blend. I decided to have them put the straight conventional oil in. Did I make a mistake by trying to save $ _NUMBER_ , or is it OK to go from a synthetic/conventional blend to only conventional oil?
Hey I have a request for my fellow Saabers that own a ng900 or a _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ ... I've had issues with the cooling fan not turning on and the car overheating recently in the hot weather, I assumed it was the radiator fan resistor that likes to fail. However I was just looking around the engine bay and opened the fusebox and noticed Maxi Fuse _NUMBER_ was upside down, like metal portion pointing to the sky. I wish I were joking: _URL_ So this is going to sound insane but I can't fathom this is how its supposed to be, can anyone that drives one of these cars check theirs or just reassure me that its supposed to be installed in fuse location _NUMBER_ ? I swore I've heard the fan running less than _NUMBER_ weeks ago, and unless this is the most epic practical joke I am apart of, I can't imagine how a fuse would have flipped itself around, not to mention it never blew or anything. The only possible thing I can think of is I had the HG replaced last summer and maybe the mechanic took it out for some reason to test the system and forgot to put it back? It makes zero sense and I can't imagine how I would have never overheated since then but I'm seriously confused over this lol
Got an _NUMBER_ Wrangler SE ( _NUMBER_ .5L I4) and I want to start driving it around the desert and the mountains a bit (San Diego County represent!) Anyway I'm looking up info on modding for offroading and realizing recovery points are the best place to start, but not seeing anything regarding details like what points to buy first, difficulty of a DIY install, price vs quality, etc. Could really use some guidance as I want to get out, but am relatively paranoid about wheeling solo.
I am looking for another car at the moment and have set my sights on either a _NUMBER_ CLS _NUMBER_ or a _NUMBER_ CLS _NUMBER_ . For those who currently own or have previously shopped for used examples of these cars, what advice do you have? What should I be looking for? What should I prepare for long term that could go wrong?
A little backstory: I drive this _NUMBER_ WRX on almost a daily basis, in Central NJ. I see lots of subies, and if it has a hoodscoop, or looks like its another Subie guy, I wave. And _NUMBER_ % of the time, if they see me, they wave back. But for some reason, if I wave at a _NUMBER_ or newer WRX or STI, they don't wave back. And I'm talking about _NUMBER_ % of the time they won't wave back. So my question to you guys is, why? Is it maybe they aren't in the "Subie" culture and therefore they don't know any better? I really highly doubt that they think they're "above" me or whatever, and I'm not upset at them, I'm just wondering here. And before I get flak for it, yes, I know the people on this subreddit with _NUMBER_ + WRX's probably wave, but that's because they 'get it'. So lets hear some explanations. Also, I want to see some pics of what you guys drive. Turbo or not, I don't care. Thanks!
Not sure if this type of post is allowed but I've been eyeing this guy and it definitely seems worth it to me but I'm not a big car guy. Are _NUMBER_ 's reliable so many years later? The KMs definitely low. Will repairs be an forseeable issue? I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post the link but I will if requested.
the clearcoat on the console insert on my street glide is starting to crack n fade, so i was thinking about replacing it with something new. anyone know a shop thst does custom ones? i have a design in mind, i just need to find someplace capable of producing it.
Hey I've got an ' _NUMBER_ Linear and want to get some local work done with a Tech _NUMBER_ . The shop has one, but not the Saab card, so I'm wondering if it's possible to just buy said card and let them use it. There's a few 32mb cards on the market is this the one I want? Is there anything I'm missing?
Subie fam I need a little help! I want to upgrade my sway bars / springs and possibly lift my car about _NUMBER_ inches. What would be the best route to go so I can maintain a nice ride but also have my car more rally ready? also what kind of tires would be good for both daily and rally driving? Also looking for a good place for wheels if you guys know where I can find a good deal.
I know its around _NUMBER_ more HP for the _NUMBER_ +. Of course the used market leaves the _NUMBER_ much cheaper for this reason I assume. I'm just wondering how 'underpowered' the _NUMBER_ down engines are... I've tried searching and didn't find much. Looking for some honest opinions if the _NUMBER_ aren't even worth considering... Thank you.
_NUMBER_ 4runner, was wondering why the center console box is so damn small, so start taking it apart in hopes to build a bigger one or just take out the bottom of the current one, and i lift it up and there is this rather large circle shaped mechanism under there, what is this? and why is it there, I have no room to put loose ends and shit XD !
I'm not sure if this is the correct place to post, I have looked for other subreddits but to no avail. Anyways, I want to switch my current car to a new Mercedes and I want to make sure I make the best deal, down to the smallest detail this is where you guys come in! I have been looking at a new s500e but also sneaked a peek at the e350e (why waste more than needed?) and I have a few questions. _NUMBER_ . What are the main perks getting an s500e over e350e? _NUMBER_ . Do you think it is worth the price difference? _NUMBER_ . Should I wait for the new s550e? Or is it s560e? Not sure what is happening right now. _NUMBER_ . Which options are a must? Money isn't an issue here, but there's no need to throw money. Thank you all!
I'm looking for wiring diagrams for the vented seat switch( _URL_ ), but cannot find anything good. Could enyone point me in the right direction? Main question is, would the heating seat switches( _URL_ ) do the same job if connected to vents?(heating switches are alot cheaper around my area)
I have a _NUMBER_ flhs and on the left side hard bag the lid is currently being held shut by a bungee cord because I can't seem to find the latches for sale anywhere. Anyone know who sells them or what exactly I should be searching for on eBay? I haven't been able to find them.
I have a _NUMBER_ Impreza rs2.5 (manual trans) This "shuddering" or "shaking" happens after I get off the freeway and try to turn into a parking space or sharp corner. The whole car shakes loudly. Sounds like it's coming from the back of the car underneath. I've heard people call it "torque bind" on forums and they say to fix it you need a new viscous coupling. Is this true? Has anyone else had this problem? Need some advice. Thanks
I have a FP3 installed on my Iron and was wondering if anyone knew a place that I could get an extension cable for it. Want to have more options of a place to put it vice just trying to stuff it into the battery compartment. Was thinking of trying to put it under the seat but right now the cables are to short. Thanks for any and all help.
So I have an _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ .0t RHD model (different reservoir to the LHD) and I can't seem to get the cap off with my hands. I've tried turning it CCW when warm and while pushing down as well, but it won't budge. The reservoir itself twists a bit which is somewhat concerning. Does anyone have any tips before I get a pair of pliers and probably break it? :/
I'm married with a kid, that's probably why. If I was single I'd already have my jeep probably _NUMBER_ years ago. I make 50k a year after taxes and all that other stuff they take. If I got a loan for a new jeep it would cost more than my home mortgage and that's with an 8k down payment. On top of that I wouldn't have much money to do anything else exciting, like vacations. I'm having a hard time justifying buying a jeep. Wondering how you all did it? Of course, speaking to ppl who are in my income class and had to finance a jeep. If I could find a good running jku with 50k or less miles for _NUMBER_ grand I'd buy it. I really need the _NUMBER_ door.
What's up guys, glad I found this reddit. I'm at _NUMBER_ miles on my car and haven't had an oil change for about close to 8k miles. I also checked out the tranny fluid and looks like it's time for it to be changed, it's pretty dark and has this slight gassy smell. I set up a general service to check the oil and everything else on Monday _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ . At the moment right now I cannot afford to have the tranny fluid to be replaced immediately but probably in like _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ weeks. My question though is I use my car to deliver packages for Amazon and I do _NUMBER_ hour shifts. In one shift I travel maybe _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ miles. Do any of you think it's okay or safe to do a _NUMBER_ hour shift today and then see the dealer tomorrow? or should I just hold off on driving until after I see the dealer? What would you do? Thanks, Mike
Hellow fellow lexus drivers. I have an es _NUMBER_ and whenever i pull out the ashtray there is a small green light. Anyway, I purchased an fm transmitter and i use it in the cig lighter thing, which makes the green light turn on. My question is, does this have any effect on the battery? Should I remove the bulb or something? Or is it small enough that i dont even have to worry about it? Any advice would be much appreciated!
So Ive seen some pics of the new type R, and it looks deadly. Great looking car. Also love the new touring...Having trouble what to buy(Will be buying early _NUMBER_ ), Im not a speed junky or anything, and have a family. But the Type R looks pretty badass. SOwould love some opinions of the two. Ive heard in terms of lastability, the cars with turbos(type R, WRX) , is much harder on the engine, therefore wont last quite as long. Anyone know if thats true? Where I live, the touring is about _NUMBER_ -34K, and my family has already bought _NUMBER_ (bro/mom), so we could probably get a discount. I belive the typeR will be low 40s. What would you get, if choosing between the two?
Naysayers may point out it would be a capital intensive process to begin work on gigafactory _NUMBER_ . It would also add fuel to the fire of people with short positions on TSLA as profitability would be driven out even further. However other car companies will need to respond to the demand for electric vehicles in order to survive. As I understand it there is not enough capacity in the world to generate lithium ion cells for any more products than what Tesla plans to produce. By that assumption if Tesla positions itself as a cell supplier they stand to be even more in control of the future market for EV batteries and may even want to start building power train components for other car companies. Akin to Apple buying displays or memory from Samsung.
I just would like to start a current thread and gather any more knowledge/advice that I can. To preface there is a fair amount of mechanical knowledge between my dad and I. I'd like this to turn into something we could work on together since I know he misses his old days of engine building with his Trans Am/GTO/Grand National/Chevelle and has recently taken a liking to the Japanese tuning scene through me. I've always wanted to have a project car to play around with and have always considered a 1JZ swap into either a Mk3 Supra or into an SC300. After talking with a guy at our local cars coffee a few times about his 1JZ swapped Mk3 and hearing it's ungodly exhaust sound (single turbo, 470whp) I knew this was the kind of swap for me. He seemed to recommend sticking with an SC300 since his Mk3 was giving him issues. So here I am now. Piecing together parts of the puzzle and combing Club Lexus/Supra forums. I know forums will likely have all my answers but I like making current and recent threads so I can organize things better as some threads seem all over the place. I don't want to get too crazy with a build. Anything in the _NUMBER_ -400hp range is plenty for me. And manual is a must. This seems to be a pretty detailed guide to parts needed: _URL_ There is a very clean looking, single owner SC300 (auto) with 110k miles near me that I think would be great to check out if I could get together a solid plan with parts and other things. I would maybe consider selling the engine/trans due to their (supposedly) decent condition to try and recoup some money due. If I'm reading everything right, it seems to be that I could budget anywhere between _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ for the car (manual would be preferred to start off with but I'm sure we all know how hard it is to find one, even though the W58 would be pulled in place of the R154). And around _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ for parts. I am piecing together a spreadsheet of parts/prices that can be viewed here: _URL_ My main concern right off the bat is extending the wiring harness as I'm not an expert in soldering. Advice/suggestions for completing this would be awesome. If you've made it this far through the wall of text and me rambling on I thank you. Not sure if all of it was needed but I wanted to give a decent background of my thought process and what I think. Any advice/suggestions/comments/concerns about taking on a project like this would be awesome.
I just purchased a _NUMBER_ Volt LT in Kinetic Blue. I typically travel _NUMBER_ miles to work and since I work at Chevy, I can plug in to get a full charge by the time I leave. So not using any gas at all, how often should I be using the gas engine as opposed to the electric...I don't want the gas to go bad. Thanks
Hey all, I have been a Volt owner since June of this year (still haven't had to buy gas yet!) and I have fallen completely in love with the car. I co-host a podcast related to Science and Technology and thought "I wonder if we could ever get Tony Posawatz to come on the show". Figuring the worst that could happen was he'd say no, we reached out to him and he agreed to talk to us for an hour! So if you'd like to hear some historical details and vision for the future straight from the man who led the Volt development, you can hear his thoughts here in episode _NUMBER_ !
Hey y'all. New to Audi and wanting to buy this car. It's got a long, verified CarFax history. Just had _NUMBER_ new tires, oil change, valve cover gasket, timing belt and water pump, cam seal, spark plugs, K&N air filter. It's a 6speed manual. Lighting package, sport package and leather power seats. Seems like a great deal for $ _NUMBER_ and the car is being sold from a reputable Audi/VW shop. I feel very confident about this purchase but wanna consult with the community. Can I expect close to 250k miles or more from this motor if I take really good care of it? Thanks in advance.
Hey everyone, just traded in my _NUMBER_ Ford Focus Titanium due to constant repairs from the day I purchased it brand new mind you. Drove home a _NUMBER_ Mazda _NUMBER_ Grand Touring edition hatchback with 25k miles on it Saturday and although it doesn't quite have all of the options that my Focus had, the drive is so much smoother and I'm looking forward to no longer dealing with constant transmission issues and the stress of wondering when I'm going to break down again. As a new owner, just looking for others repair histories (aside from the normal stuff) and also looking for some decent car seat cover suggestions as well as if anyone has installed any sort of audio equipment that they'd like to share. Looking for covers because I sometimes drive clients around who don't always have the cleanest clothing and the leather in this car is a beige/tan color. Mine also has the Bose system but it's just not as good as the Sony that came with my Focus. Not looking to shake the door panels off my car, just looking for some more volume, better sound distribution, and a small sub. Looking forward to owning this vehicle for many years, hopefully years without any of the issues my Ford gave me.
My uncle gave me his old car, that has seen some better days. I have been driving it for a few months now. I just love the car it is fully optioned, the engine is just amazing and very fast. But it has many problems that I know of and here they are: _NUMBER_ . I have to add oil every week or so, as it burns it. _NUMBER_ . It will not pass a smug test _NUMBER_ . I think the traction control is off, because of some computer trouble. _NUMBER_ . It may need a new paint job. _NUMBER_ . It slips a lot when it is wet. But other than that the interior is still very nice, and did I mention it has heated/cooled seats. Is it worth repairing as I don't really want to buy a new shitty car nor do I want to buy a used car which I don't know what are its problems. Any advice. thanks
Hi, recently bought my first Accord and it is smoother, quieter, and more comfortable and effortless than my BMW. &nbsp; At startup, the service soon light blinks and goes away after a few seconds. &nbsp; I get rough idles intermittently as if it has something to do with the heater or ac system like a fan turning on and off causes it. When I say rough, I mean more noise and slight vibration compared to absolute quiet and no vibration as it runs most of the time. This roughness comes on and then goes off as if it is an accessory cycling on and off like a fan. &nbsp; I notice the head lights get _NUMBER_ % dimmer intermittently too. Only for a few seconds while driving or idle. I've had older halogen cars that did this too maybe it's normal. &nbsp; Tapping noise from the engine when acceleration but not at cruise speeds. I expect this is nothing to be too concerned with since my old BMW had the same issue with the lifters. The noise is quite subtle but worth a mention.
_URL_ Has anyone tried this? Not a bad price for something that can save you tons on tickets. Does anyone live in New York and has any experience driving around without their front plates? I really want to remove mine as it ruins the grill and bumper. How long have you been driving without one and how many tickets have you accumulated in that amount of time?
So I recently upgraded my _NUMBER_ Honda Pilot EX headunit/infotainment screen to a _NUMBER_ unit. I bought the _NUMBER_ headunit that came from a _NUMBER_ Honda Pilot EX from LKQOnline. Every time I boot up the car, it asks for an anti\-theft radio code. I can temporarily bypass it, but the headunit would shut off after a few minutes. I tried using https://radio\-navicode.honda.com to retrieve my anti\-theft radio code, but I keep getting an error that says "**The Serial Number you entered does not match those on file for this VIN."** I entered the serial of the new headunit and the VIN# associated with it. I don't know why it gives me that message. Do y'all know how I can retrieve the anti\-theft codes? I am so frustrated at this point.
I'm in a pickle. I currently drive a _NUMBER_ F150 Lariat with some fairly consistent transmission failures. I have the option of buying a _NUMBER_ Taurus SHO from my sister for slightly less than asking price with a loan. I recently drove the car on a weekend getaway _NUMBER_ miles round trip. The car is a ton of fun to drive, and the only thing holding me back from buying it is it's not a truck. My accountant sister says I don't need _NUMBER_ vehicles while I have my student loan debt, but I really enjoy my truck. I can afford both as my truck is paid off, and I could call my insurance company to get insurance put on when I use it for truck things: target shooting, hunting, fishing, hauling. Is this something many people do? Do you have any advice for me? Do any of you own both a car and truck at the same time now or previously?
So have been a BMW guy for _NUMBER_ years but have been attracted to the Panamera GTS for awhile now and likely going to pull the trigger on a CPO. While the one I was initially looking at is a _NUMBER_ with very low mileage, a karma red _NUMBER_ caught my eye and the price was a good deal less. When dismissed on the basis of not wanting to run a luxury car out of warranty the agent told me about the insane extended warranty options available. Firstly, the _NUMBER_ has _NUMBER_ full years of bumper to bumper with an option to extend every year for _NUMBER_ .2k usd. Full bumper to bumper, not the normal limited one that's usual for extended. Up to _NUMBER_ years and 200k kilometers... what am I missing? This sounds entirely too good to be true. I just feel like there is a catch I'm missing. Anyone have experience with extended coverage warranty and how fussy the dealerships are at honoring them for full coverage (obviously not including expendables)? _URL_
I have a _NUMBER_ X3 xDrive28i SUV with the premium sound system. It has always mind boggled me that a newer vehicle, especially a BMW, has Bluetooth technology for connecting phone audio but not multimedia for music. Even my mom's Ford Escape has this feature. Anyway, since that's just the way it is, I wondered how other owners addressed this. Although not the most convenient, I didn't usually mind to use my auxillary cord which has equally good sound quality as when playing things on the radio/XM/USB port. My newest phone however, Google Pixel _NUMBER_ XL, doesn't have an auxiliary port (That's a whole other irritating issue but it seems like phone manufactures are moving in that direction, so I digress.) My only option for music from my phone is to use Bluetooth. All that being said, I have tried a handful of different Bluetooth audio transmitters. Some sounded terrible with a lot of static, sounding "under water", non-existent bass/treble, etc. The most recent I got remains connected in the center console to both power outlet the auxiliary port (BlueStream). It cost around $ _NUMBER_ at Best Buy. It sounds ok but still sounds incredibly low quality compared to the radio or running directly from phone to auxiliary. No static type sound but very low bass/treble. quality, volume has to be turned up significantly, etc. I've played a lot with the equalizer options but no luck there either. I plan on keeping this car for quite a while so I want a better solution if one exists. The car is still under warranty plus I don't like consideration of any aftermarket sterio replacement options. Has anyone had better luck with another option? I'm not so concerned with price if the sound quality is good. I tried to include as much info as possible. Please don't be too hard on me for my long post haha.
Volvo folks If this was your car... what would be the first things you did/looked over on it? Here's what this _NUMBER_ XC70 _NUMBER_ .5T with 125K miles has had done since _NUMBER_ (from 109K miles onwards). Brake booster Cluster reflow ignition coils Ignition lock New battery New starter New timing belt, water pump, and tensioner New sway bars (front rear) Rear stay bars New radiator A/C recharge A wheel bearing was replaced, as well as a ball joint (not in pairs it seems) _NUMBER_ front ABS sensor Regular oil changes with conventional oil So glad someone else paid for these repairs (- the ignition lock). The car was bought from a dealership by the previous owner in late _NUMBER_ at that time a long list of things were checked. All but the A/C and heater scored "good", with the a/c being recharged soon after. Brakes were at _NUMBER_ % front and rear. No record of transmission fluid change I'm intending on introducing new tranny fluid slowly through a drain fill every few thousand kms. No signs of transmission problems. The PCV system is good, based off "the glove test" I'm debating on if I should service this early before issues arise. It was "visually inspected" in _NUMBER_ , though I have no idea what a visual inspection would entail (maybe the glove test). I had front wheel spin on a slippery, slushy day -once on an incline from a stopped position, and once after hitting the gas too hard from a stopped position in slush perhaps that means the AWD is out, but if it is I don't particularly care. The car was bought for cargo space and the safety features (and the reasonable price tag vs the Subarus in my area. It's also much more attractive than the Subarus imo). I'm going to have the angle gear checked for leaks when I service the tranny. Anything else?
So as the title states I am going to be buying a new (used) Volvo since my old VW broke down a few months ago. I am a college student and need AWD to get up the mountains for snowboarding in the winter. My price range is probably up to $ _NUMBER_ so I'm probably looking for something in the _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ range. What models do you guys suggest looking for and what are some common problems I should be keeping my eye out for? Most of what I've seen on Craigslist have about 100k miles for what is in my price range. Edit: thanks for the replies!
Hello everyone, wondering if someone can help me out. My car recently just got hot I did notice my radiator fan is not coming but does come on when I turn on the Ac only for only about _NUMBER_ mins and than shuts off and than ac compressor also shuts off. I replaced the (Engine temperature sensor) thinking that was it but still no luck I did replace the radiator fan and module which is all one piece about _NUMBER_ year ago due too original one giving out. There's no check Engine light.
Hello reddit. i bought a used _NUMBER_ w203 panoramic coupe, the previous owner said that sunroof is broken and can't be open but the shade works. Well the shade got stuck open, when i press the button there's absolutely no sound and no movement whatsoever any ideas?
First time poster to Redit here I haven't cracked the engine open yet but the initial diagnosis is a thrown rod or spun bearing. Long story short, it appears a gasket blew out and dumped the oil before the car could be pulled off the free way and the engine shut down as the car was being stopped on the side of the road. Car was towed to mechanic who does not do internal engine work so he did not crack it open but put oil back in it to see if it would start, it did, sounded like shit and he immediately shut it down and said most likely a thrown rod or spun bearing. Car was towed back to my house and sits there. A shop close to my house, that works on engines, said it will need a new engine, whether used or rebuilt. Is this worth the fix? I love this car but needs some advice from you all.
So I've had my model x back to the SC three times now (for other things) but each time I tell them to check the brakes. the first time they say it's normal for the first _NUMBER_ miles. The second time they say that's normal for the first _NUMBER_ miles. This last time they said it's normal for _NUMBER_ miles but did a brake burn in anyhow and it still squeals non stop like a $ _NUMBER_ jalopy. Is this just my special snowflake X, or do others have this long brake breakin period? (Edit Sorry mods, I'd love to flair but don't have that option on bacon reader from my cell phone. Any help appreciated. I'll flair it when i get to my home computer. )
Does anyone else have issues with their heated seats not being that hot? I've got a _NUMBER_ RC _NUMBER_ and I swear the heated seats just barely warm up the bottom, and barely do the back. Other basic cars like a RAV4 make me turn down the seats because they're so hot. Should I take it in to get looked at or are these seat heaters just lousy?
Hello r/Wrangler, There is a new sub that you guys might be interested in: r/AmateurCarPorn. It is a SFW sub dedicated to Redditors sharing pics/videos of their cars. All makes and models are welcome. Come check it out and showoff your cars! *Thanks to the mods for allowing me to post this*
From what I believe, I was told it was a _NUMBER_ v8. I Haven't been able to take proper pictures because the place is closed by the time I get off work. It's 6k. **Update** I just went today and took some more pics, the rust is limited to few spots in the exterior, the car is a bit "Dusty" due to the environment where I live,, but am in all, the car seems fine. The guy whose selling it told me we can start it up next Thursday. You guys think it's worth the deal? _URL_ _URL_
So I got a flat the other day and had a flatbed truck come. Lo and Behold I tell him about the tow hook you are supposed to use for pulling it on the ramp and gave him the instructions from Chevy. Well for some reason there was no tow hook where it is supposed to be under the tire inflator. I bought the card used, but surely if the guy who had it before used it -couldn't he have just put it back? Is it usable more than once? Anyone know where to get a knew one? Is it the same as an vehicle or does it need a specific one. I couldn't find much Google. Any help is appreciated. This is a _NUMBER_ volt premier.
I recently got a piece of borosilicate for my MP mini. The glass, however, is not square, the piece is a rectangle that measures the same size as the bed. All of the clips I see on Thingiverse are for small squares like 130mm and 140mm. That makes sense since the bed has a little room to allow for the clip to rest. I was curious if anyone has come across bed clips that would allow me to use a rectangle glass that is the same size as the bed. The glass is 130mm x 160mm and is _NUMBER_ .5mm thick.
A few days ago I made this post about my issue with getting the filament to stick to the bed. I took a lot of the advice and tried it, however I usually can't get more than halfway done with printing the cat. I'm going to give my exact process of printing and hopefully you can help me identify what I'm doing wrong. PROCESS: _NUMBER_ . I put blue painters tape on the bed of printer. _NUMBER_ . I make sure the bed is leveled out. _NUMBER_ . I preheat the extruder to _NUMBER_ . I am using PLA which says to preheat from _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ . _NUMBER_ . I will SOMETIMES preheat the bed to _NUMBER_ . I have tried both preheating and not preheating the bed but it does not seem to make any difference. _NUMBER_ . After everything is heated up I will apply a light layer of glue using a glue stick to the bed. _NUMBER_ . I then begin to print the cat. _NUMBER_ . When the platform is finished printing and the actual cat starts to print I will usually bump the printing speed from _NUMBER_ to _NUMBER_ . RESULTS: About halfway through the print, the filament will unstick from the bed. Sometimes the actual filament touching the bed will stay sticking to the bed, but the filament in between the filament platform and the cat will unstick. Sometimes a bit of the tape on the bed will start to peel up (not much at all but just little spots here and there). Thanks for your help! Edit: It seems like I am using the wrong type of filament! I will order the right type and make a follow up post if I am still having issues. Thanks for all the help!
Hi guys, I am looking to get a new car...I'm interested in the following: _NUMBER_ 335i coupe X drive M package _NUMBER_ 335i coupe X drive (maybe M package) _NUMBER_ 335i X drive M package _NUMBER_ M3 coupe Now the _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ cost about _NUMBER_ -26K Canadian. The _NUMBER_ is about 32K. The M3 is about 30K I am not a tuner and looking for a fun daily driver...maybe the M is not the smartest one to get...but I just got divorced and looking for something fun but won't cost me a fortune to maintain...I also live in Montreal so we get a lot of snow. What do you guys think?
Only when it's on gas, sometimes accelerating it almost sounds like it's not shifting and the engine roars until I slow down. Also in general the engine is noisy, I don't know if that's because you barely hear the electric so hearing anything is noticable. Side thread, has anyone ever had their electric range go down significantly after a recharge? I charged it two days ago with 37mi and today it's 33mi? If anything I'll just cycle the battery and see if a 2nd charge would fix it.
Hey everyone, I figured I would give the dealer I bought my car from a chance because why not. Well I now regret that decision. Story starts Monday morning. Wheels were brand new in the boxes with the cover over the face of the wheels. Tech told me it would be about _NUMBER_ mins to _NUMBER_ hour. Fast forward to _NUMBER_ hours in and the guy who checked me in comes out and says "Hey sorry its taking longer that I thought they want to be extra careful to NOT scratch the new wheels when mounting the tires." And I thought, wow that's great they're being careful. Anyway it ends up taking just over TWO HOURS to mount wheels and tires and put the wheels back onto the car. So they come get me, and it was snowing pretty heavy at the time so I didn't get a full look at each wheel, just the driver side ones. I wanted to get out of the snow and head to work. Another bad idea. Well fast forward to yesterday I was getting gas and wanted to take a picture of my car (obviously) so I went to the front passenger side and noticed what looked to be dirt on the outside lip of the wheel so I tried to wipe it with a microfiber cloth, was not dirt. It was the silver metal exposed from under the black (powder coat?). And to top it off there's a rather huge gash that looks like they used black filler in and that's why it took over two hours at the dealer because they let the filler/touch up paint dry. Every wheel looks perfect except the front passenger one. I know wheels will evidently get scratched and whatnot but it's the fact that they tried to cover it up and hide it from me. Did they really think I wouldn't notice or care?. I'm going back Saturday morning, will be pretty much asking for a new wheel. I will include a picture album in the comments since this limits me to one picture. TL;DR dealer scratched brand new wheel and tried to cover it up and didn't tell me.
I am buying a civic hatchback soon, two weeks, and have been aiming for LX, but sort of interested in the sport. Only reason I am against sport is the sales literature stating premium fuel is required. Is that a hard requirement or just to squeeze out more hp? I am a casual driver, just like the sport trim look a bit more. Thanks.
Hey folks! I've been doing a bunch of research, and looking around this sub but wanted to put out the question. Is there a quality/reliability/other reason I shouldn't consider the RX? I want a luxury SUV that has some sporting quality (even if it's just looks). Love to hear your thoughts!
I test drove a _NUMBER_ Fit EX last night. Overall I really enjoyed and will likely be buying it but I was very startled at how loud the vent blower is past Level _NUMBER_ . _NUMBER_ was loud, but manageable.. _NUMBER_ was like a jet engine. Last few cars i've had were Hyundai Accent , Saturn LS, Ford Focus... the fit vent was the loudest by far. Is this just the standard? A common issue? Wanted to clarify before moving any further.
Looks like I lost a headlight and a brake light over the past couple of weeks. Funny because I just had my state inspection _NUMBER_ weeks ago _EMOJI_ . At any rate, I remember buying some better/brighter bulbs for my _NUMBER_ ' sonata, but I don't recall what they were and I'm positive they were a different bulb. It looks like this one takes a _NUMBER_ . What are my options for a better/brighter bulb?
I'm very interested in getting a _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ -door hatchback Veloster Turbo soon. Only thing I'm hesitant about is winter driving? How well does this fun whip handle in snowy conditions. Disclaimer I live in Edmonton, Alberta and we can have some pretty deadly winters. Also will be driving long highways for work everyday. Thoughts?
Bought the truck for when I moved down to Pennsylvania. Never used 4X4 on it yet, was thinking about to tonight with snow but remembered the owner saying to never initiate the 4X4 on pavement. Is this true? It's a ' _NUMBER_ F- _NUMBER_ Reg Cab XLT with a _NUMBER_ .3l. Also, aside from not using it on pavement, told from another person that you just lock the hubs and drive. Be it in reverse to get out of a spot or forward if you can. Replaced the transfer case and it's basically brand new so I'm not looking to break the thing.
2nd gen with 22re First off I'm fully aware this engine will never be a power horse. I've done a lot of tune up and maintenance on it. It even reads _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ psi across all _NUMBER_ cylinders. But it just really struggles going up hills! I live in BC too. Most of the time I can maintain 100km/h or so but other times it really struggles! This is even with no passengers, no cargo, and quarter tank of gas. Is it safe to hit _NUMBER_ in 3rd gear?! Since I need a new exhaust anyway, I'm thinking if getting long tube headers and running _NUMBER_ " id piping all the way out back. I'm pretty pretty sure any kind of engine mod is just a waste of money/time. Does electric fan or battery/intake swap make a difference? I did some research but opinions seem to vary. But is it worthwhile to re gear? Currently running near stock tires, _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ .
I've had my printer for about a month and I've been using an old crappy laptop for my prints, I typically use my chromebook for everything and it doesn't support Cura, someone told me about linux and I did that but still can't figure out how to get cura on there. If anyone can help me out that would be greatly appreciated!
I'm holding off a bit before purchasing a dedicated laptop for my printer (it's going to be a used, cheap budget laptop strictly for Cura and other slicing software). My main machine is a macbook pro, and for some reason all of the mac versions of these softwares are wonky and hard to set up due to a lack of mac tutorials. So yeah, until then I'd love to get ahold of these gcodes to print out right away, or possibly share where I could find actual gcodes I can just throw directly onto an SD card and print without issue.
So I bought my dream truck, a _NUMBER_ Trail edition with KDSS (I drive in the city all week). Noticed the KDSS seemed to be leaking when I first test drove the truck, the dealer claimed they had previously replaced the KDSS pump, lines, etc. on the truck and it would be good to go when I picked it up the next week. It's not. It worked fine for about a month or so and has just acted up ever since. Loud rattles, loose feeling front end, dash lights, the whole nine. Different dealer wants $ _NUMBER_ to fix it. So what are my options, wise reddit? Has anyone replaced the KDSS with regular old sway bar links? Anyone removed it completely? Anyone wanna point me to a knowledgeable tech?
It seems like everyone says that a truck in the rust belt brand new will be a shit box in _NUMBER_ years. Is that an exaggerated or is it really that bad? I live somewhere where it never snows but occasionally want to take my truck ( _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ times a year max) to a location that uses brine on their roads. It's my first brand new vehicle and I'd rather not get it exposed to salt if it will do irreparable damage but I'm not sure if going a few times, assuming I rinse it off after each trip, will damage the truck? It is a thing where once salt touches it, the truck starts to rust over time, or does it require continuous exposure to rust?
Bought an xc60 ( _NUMBER_ dieael, im on Europe)in May _NUMBER_ from a dealer. Since then, my fuel level sensor broke down, had an issue with immobiliser (ignition changed), the computer restarts on random occasions ( _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ times that I noticed) and now apparently the oil level rose to a level that needed garages intervention (quick fix with removing some oil, will need to check with my dealer for reason). I feel that it's a bit excessive for a brand new car. I'd expect more from volvo. Thoughts anyone?
I know for the n54 engines its _NUMBER_ years _NUMBER_ miles but I'm at about _NUMBER_ . I was reading on forums that some dealerships still replaced it for some people even though they were out of warranty. Has anyone experienced this? Also how much does it cost to replace it?
Hi guys. I own a _NUMBER_ IS 220D Sport Last week I got the DPF removed and a stage _NUMBER_ repro. It's now making 212whp and it sounds nice. The avg fuel consumption dropped to around _NUMBER_ .3L/100km which is a big improvement over the _NUMBER_ .4L/100km it was making My question is. What's the difference between The avg and tank avg. Currently it is showing _NUMBER_ .3Avg and _NUMBER_ .2Tank Avg. I reset the Avg everytime I refuel. What's the difference between those ?
I know that modifying Volvos is popular, but how many owners here have retrofitted older Volvo alloys to newer models like the C30, S40, V50, S60, S80, XC70, V70 models? The alloy wheels I am mentioning are: Cetus Centaurus Columbia Tellus I don't own a Volvo currently . I'm interested to know if you've done this as a modification equally, would the newer alloys fit well, to an older Volvo, e.g. the _NUMBER_ or _NUMBER_ ?
Thinking about purchasing a Subaru _NUMBER_ Crosstrek. Most likely the limited version. To those that own a ** _NUMBER_ ** Subaru Crosstrek, what are your thoughts on it? Pros? Cons? Do you regret purchasing it? I don't care too much about the speed... after all I'm not planning on racing with it (lol). How's the road noise, the steering/agility, etc.?
I'm going to be installing a dash cam that has a parking mode. The hardwiring kit needs to be hooked up to an always on source and an accessory source to tell when the car is on/off. I need some help deciding which fuses to tap into with an add a fuse. I'm pretty sure about adding a fuse to the center console outlet because I hardly use it. However, I'm unsure about the always on source. I've heard people tapping into the power doors or lights? Any suggestions? Here's the link to the fuse box. Thanks.
So I'm in the middle of a wife ordered christmas ornament production run and due to some bungling on my part with my first clog my thermister bites the dust. I manage to kinda get it back to how it should be and don't notice that it doesn't take and thermal runaway and white smoke with black/brown goop and my PTFE tube is now toast and yeah... thermister is completely unusable now (glass bead broke). Sooo... I need to get back up and running sooner rather than later. What are my options. I've been reading various faq's, instructions, etc... and maybe I'm just an idjit but I'd like something as close to plug and play as possible or at least minimum hassle, fast shipping and sadly a bit price conscious as I also just recently bought a monoprice maker select plus which sadly can't do the ornaments that the mini can (thing handles overhangs horribly and no tweaks are fixing it). So I could print up some PLA parts to help fit a new hotend in but I'd really like to just get the parts, slap them in, do some calibration and get printing again. I've considered an E3D lite. A reprap replacement, E3d block and sock replacement (though I think that's out). The E3D lite would be at the upper end of my budget I think and that sucks because I'd kind of like to go full metal on the off chance I want to print nylon, etc... Suggestions?
It always makes me happy to see people still wrenching on, maintaining, and riding their bikes from youth (70s/80s). Today trade ins are a common thing, but what's one bike you can't imagine parting with? The one to ride til the end? Personally, even though I'll be moving on to a bigger bike, I plan on keeping my ' _NUMBER_ Sporster just for how surprisingly fun it's been around town and the reliability factor for taking the abuse while I was learning to ride.
Has anyone had any experience removing/storing a hard top while in college? I like it better than the Trektop NX that came with my Wrangler. However, I still want the ability to remove the top. Storage of the top is my big concern. Anyone have any good solutions for storing the top? I don't see carrying it up the stairs into my apartment being a viable option... not to mention I don't think there's anywhere in my apartment to store it.
Been talking with someone selling a modded _NUMBER_ premium GT (Roush parts). It's a manual with just about 50k miles, seems pretty well taken care of and everything. Only thing I'm worried about is the MT- _NUMBER_ transmissions in these, which is why I was primarily looking for an auto. He offered a really good price though, and a lot of the mods are things I would've done. My question is whether the issues with the transmission are as prevalent with the _NUMBER_ +? I plan adding a supercharger with around _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ pounds of boost within the first year of ownership, and wouldnt want any issues to arise for a while. Any other input is welcome. Thanks!
I recently got to drive a new F150 _NUMBER_ .7L and a Sierra _NUMBER_ .3L. I really love the interior of the GMC as well as the simplicity of it. However the throttle response is setup for fuel economy and I absolutely cannot stand it at all I'm considering going with the Ecoboost Ford (I hate the interior and I'm no sure if I could love with it day to day. The throttle response on the GMs are so bad,i honestly could not live with it). just because of that one issue. Does anyone else think the throttle response kinda sucks? Anyone know of any fixes (like a tune) Does tow/haul mode help in anyway? I've driven a lot of the older _NUMBER_ .3L with the _NUMBER_ -sp on the previous gen and thought they were great.
Im currently buying a _NUMBER_ Tucson. I sat down with the salesman and chose to go with the colosseum gray. It looks great on the website. However when I googled images of the vehicle it is a similar, yet obviously different colour. Is this normal for major dealerships? I have to say it's pretty frustrating. I've been excited for a few weeks now only to realize I'm not getting what I paid for. Luckily I noticed before I picked it up and I'm able to choose a different colour. I would have been pretty angry if I showed up didn't get what I was told I was getting.
Has anyone noticed if there's been an increase in collision warning false positives? The odd part is that the dashboard doesn't explain why it went off; generally, there's a red obstacle in front of the car. AEB is not activated when these alerts go off. Autopilot is on. Any ideas?
So I'm currently in the process of buying a Wrangler _NUMBER_ JKu. It's hard to fit all the options I want into my budget so I'm thinking of cutting them out and installing them later. Has anyone installed their own heated seats or should I not mess with that and just get the option? Is it worth upgrading the stereo and speakers at all or will the base stock system suffice and offer better upgrade ability aftermarket wise later on down the road? Thanks guys.
I joined the BMW family one year ago when I bought a used ' _NUMBER_ 328i. My warranty just expired and I am worried about repair costs in the future. Right now the car has about 41k miles on it and I drive around 15k/yr. Can anyone tell me what I should expect as far as problems/repairs and what maintenance can be done to prevent anything major as I put more miles on the car? Personal experience and links would be appreciated!
_NUMBER_ Honda Accord Coupe EX 4CYL Recently went to the dealer for an oil change and was given the recommendation to do a power steering fluid flush due to the fluid being dirty. I have had no issues with my steering thus far, at what mileage do you normally perform this procedure? Additionally, I've performed the routine oil changes, brakes/tires, transmission fluid drain/refill every 30k, brake fluid every 30k, and spark plugs/valve adjustment at 100k. I am under the impression that my car has a timing chain which does not need to be replaced, how about the water pump? Any other preventative maintenance I should get done at 135k? Thank you in advance!
As the title says...I've read through the sidebar a bit and found the advise very useful. However, I'm looking for a old basket case or a run down junker to rebuild. I'm not looking to flip it or anything like that, just want a project to keep me busy in the colder months and hopefully the joy of firing it up! I've been digging around craigslist for a while and found an old _NUMBER_ ' sporster that caught my eye here . I don't want to buy a bike to simply replace every part and would love to keep some character. But I'm not really sure what to look for in older bikes like that. Anybody here got any advice for a new wrencher looking for a long term project bike?
_URL_ Right rear LCA Mount, third gen. Vs road debris and of course I had the skids off. Ripped a few chunks out. Any off road guys know if this is something to worry about/repair? Off road shop? Welded? Drives fine. Just found it when I pulled it apart to fix something unrelated. I'm worried the ripped metal will start cracking.
Hey all, as of recent the bluetooth on my car has been having issues for some unknown reason. I can connect any phone at any time to the Bluetooth and it will connect without any problems but when I try to play anything no sound comes out from the car speakers in the slightest. It would be great if anyone had a solution, it would be much appreciated!!
Time has come for a new car and we have decided on a _NUMBER_ X5 35i, getting rid of our ' _NUMBER_ 4Runner Limited. With my 4Runner, I have always been so happy that I got the Limited with all the bells and whistles as the price difference was negligible and it looks so much better than the base. I would like to do the same thing with this X5, but I am having the hardest time finding information about which trim levels have what. Like which one has which wheels, panoramic sunroof, surround cameras, Nevada leather, roof rails, power tailgate, paint matched fender trim etc. Any info or links would be great. Thanks!
Hello everyone. I was wondering if I could get some of your thoughts on this deal. This is a used, company demo _NUMBER_ AUDI A4 FWD Premium plus. _NUMBER_ .0T PREMIUM PLUS / TECHNOLOGY / NAVIGATION / BANG OLUFSEN I was quoted $ _NUMBER_ out the door. The list price is $ _NUMBER_ Company demo vehicle from reputable dealership. Thoughts? Attached sticker: _URL_
Hi all, I was hoping you guys might have some insight into a problem I'm having. Yesterday I replaced the passenger side HID bulb, which involved unclipping the MAF sensor, and removing the air cleaner box+snorkel. Midway through, I decided I needed more space, so I turned on the car and reversed a few feet out of the garage. The engine was on for _NUMBER_ seconds max. There were warning lights everywhere of course, but I figured there would be, with the MAF sensor disconnected. I finished the headlight replacement, reinstalled everything. I go to check if the bulb works, and the CEL and traction control lights are on, and the display in the instrument cluster reads "Check VSC". The lights and warnings persist through a couple cycles of turning the car off/on. I disconnected the battery and let the car sit overnight, haven't checked if the lights are still on, but is there a possibility that I damaged something during this process? Sorry for the wall of text
Gotta _NUMBER_ c350. 87k miles and an M272 and the engine number matches the balance shaft issue. Today, my engine light came on and the entire cabin started shaking. It stopped after I restarted the car. I went to autozone and got a free code scan and it gave me some cryptic intake manifold codes and a cylinder misfire, but only after restarting the code reader a couple times. Other than that nothing. I just had _NUMBER_ cylinders fixed for a misfire, after the same issue. Does this sound like an incoming disaster to you guys? Should I sell now? Just a little concerned after hearing the horror stories
Has anyone installed a DIY Qi charger in their Lexus? I have a _NUMBER_ ES _NUMBER_ and was struggling where I could install it. There's no spot for it on the center console and I don't want to put the wireless charger in the storage console as it seems to defeat the purpose. I thought about mounting it under the console lid but after fiddling with it yesterday realized the leather on the lid is just too thick. I find I mostly put my phone in the driver's side door hand pull. I just have a regular iPhone _NUMBER_ (not the plus) and it fits in their snuggly with my case on. Going to try and pop the door panel off tomorrow and see what's directly behind that and then see if I can mount the charger there. Hopefully the plastic isn't too thick that the charger won't work. But I'm not against shaving it down in the back some with a Dremel to get it to work. Anyone have something more elegant that they have done in their ES or other model Lexus?
I'm searching for a project/driver Volvo as I save. One of the things that fascinated me about Volvos was that some have a fuel pump access hatch, allowing me to replace a faulty pump without dropping the tank or cutting a hole. Which models and years have this feature?
Before I get into doing too many things to my TJ I'm wanting to put in my own additional fuse box so I don't mess with any of the factory wiring. I'm looking at this because it has _NUMBER_ fuses as well as _NUMBER_ 30A relays in one box. Has anyone used any of these? If so how did you like it? I'm still trying to look into the "Delphi Packard _NUMBER_ Metri-Pack" connectors since it uses those instead of screw terminals, I'm not sure how much money/time they will take. I was also looking at this which is nice because it also has a negative bus and don't have to screw with other connectors, but then I have to add external relays too, which makes it less clean imo.
I picked up said vehicle very recently and while everything is great, one problem with the car is the bluetooth phone call connectivity. A lot of static on both ends of the call. However playing music via bluetooth is perfect only phone calls. Has anyone else faced this issue with their lexus/toyota vehicles? Will be contacting the dealer soon. EDIT: Used my dad's iphone (bell) and it works flawlessly. My LGG4 (virgin) on the other hand...
I am trying to buy a set of anzo headlights made specifically for my _NUMBER_ honda accord but upon reading I noticed that both bulb sizes (high and low) are _NUMBER_ while my current OEM headlights are _NUMBER_ on the low and _NUMBER_ . How can I work around this issue and get the anzos to work?
Hello! I am looking for blue, leather seat covers for my boyfriend for Christmas and was wondering if anyone has any ideas. I saw these (I'd like to keep the price around $ _NUMBER_ if possible, but let me know if that's not doable), but I've never bought anything from CARiD before. If anyone knows more about Volt accessories and what a Volt owner would want for Christmas, and specifically suggestions about seat covers, I would love input! Thanks!
To start, I know traditional advice is the run from flood cars but hear me out please. I'm a _NUMBER_ y/o car enthusiast and I'm really interested in getting an air-cooled _NUMBER_ for a project car. My love of Porsche started with my father's car a red _NUMBER_ ' Turbo. He recently passed away and working on cars I think is the best way for me to remember him. Anyway, that brings me to my point, I don't have a ton in savings only about 60k or so. I noticed on iaai.com there are flood 911s for cheap. I have electronics, motor, trans and everything from a ' _NUMBER_ that was rear ended, minor damage except for exhaust. So I would remove everything from the flood car and just use the body. Is it feasible to get one of these cars for _NUMBER_ -5k?
Hey r/Honda, I'm considering getting a set of lowering springs for my _NUMBER_ Accord sedan, either from Eibach or HR. I've read a little about them and I'm getting conflicting information. Some say that springs from Eibach and or HR will be bad for my shock absorbers and others say they are made for OEM absorbers. Which is it? If I purchase new lowering springs and shocks, will I need to replace the shocks within 50k miles? I'm only looking for roughly a _NUMBER_ " drop. Any other information is appreciated.
Hello you all. My entire life I have always wanted to drive a BMW. In January of _NUMBER_ , I made that dream come true ( _NUMBER_ 328i). I poured over forums for months predating the purchase, learning everything that I could. I swore to myself that I wouldn't become the stereotypical young BMW purchaser (was _NUMBER_ at the time). Well, fast forward and now its _NUMBER_ . My car is my most prized possession and we have been through a lot together, and I have taken the odometer from about 74k to about 94k, but here's the catch. Financially, I wasn't nearly as prepared as I thought I was (live learn). Living paycheck to paycheck, I havent been able to do my car justice with upkeep (exactly what i promised myself I wouldnt do). Recently, I have financially gotten into a much better position and I'm ready to make up for that lost time. I want this car to run for the rest of my life. It is my dream car. I am willing to put the love and care into it, but I need your help. I have done _NUMBER_ engine maintenance in all this time. I have a strong suspicion that all facets of the suspension are blown and need replaced. I am ready to get started, but I am overwhelmed. What should I prioritize to get this baby purring like the day I got her? Currently there are no check engine lights or anything like that but I am missing some pep that it used to have. Where do I start? It's time to make this right. edit: I'll be monitoring this thread and can answer any questions. Thanks in advance for your time. We are blessed to have such a knowledgable and passionate community of drivers.
So, I have a _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ Aero that's got the intermittent no-start blues, and after bouncing around for several months fixing everything in the ignition pathway, it seems like the ECU is the issue. A new ECU programmed to the car's VIN is the better part of US$1k and _NUMBER_ months away. As I understand it (which is to say, badly), it should be possible to dump and restore the ECU configuration to a used ECU using TrionicCANFlasher or CMDFlash, and to marry the used ECU to my Saab in the usual way with a Tech II. Brew City can't do the ME9 in-house, but they seemed confident that this was easily doable. Swedish Automotive in Seattle are convinced it's impossible and the VIN has to be factory-programmed. So, anyone game in southwestern BC or western WA? Bonus if you're in Victoria or Olympia, or willing to come to me, because the last thing I want to do is abandon my bricked car if something goes wrong. Bonus points if you already have a used ECU/ME9 on hand ( _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ ). Would love any suggestions, and to be able to throw a non-trivial amount of money at a fellow Saab enthusiast who has a Tech II, experience with ECU flashing, and more patience/confidence than I do. Thanks!
I own a _NUMBER_ Saab _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ .0t and it is a great little car. I am more than happy with my purchase and i got it for a great price. Now this being said it has some issues with the radio, i tried to fix it, it being the amp. Which resulted in my radio getting no power whatsoever, along with my sounds not working (turn signal, seatbelt alarm, etc...) So today i tried to yank out the actual radio itself, which i did successfully. I planned on leaving it out, and buying a new radio to put in it, mostly because that would be cheaper than replacing the amp. With the radio out, i went to start my vehicle, it would not crank. I'm assuming this is some security thing issued on the car. Plugged the radio back in, starts like always. So my question is, how do i get an aftermarket radio into my Saab? I'm looking for any help possible. TL;DR how do i "bypass" the security and put an aftermarket radio in my _NUMBER_ Saab _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ .0t?
Soooo as the title suggests I'm trying to find out if any companies make LED lowbeams with an adapter to fit _NUMBER_ Saab _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ 's So far I've only seen the metal adapters for VW's , Audi's, Merc's, and Jeeps but none for Saab. Some people are advertising their LEDs as fitting the Saabs but without that adapter I don't believe them. Anyone know of any companies?
My father bought a used _NUMBER_ ml320 with 165k miles. From what I read online, it's a bad idea to buy many used luxury cars if you don't have money for repairs. He paid 3k for it. I did a free win check, and it says, the history is clean. The engine is 3L NA V6 single overhead cam (SOHC) 18V, automatic. I know some about cars, mostly diy on my honda, but I had to google how to open the hood on a mercedes. So yea, don't know anything about them. I tried to open engine oil cap to check to see if there was any coolant leak mixes, but for the life of me, couldn't even get it to turn. And yes, he did not get this car inspected. He bought it from a friend. The engine seems to run good. It does have to weird smell. The inside looks like it got flooded, but the history report says, its clean. So I don't know. I did a check on vehiclehistory.com. What are you thoughts on this car?
Wrecked my ' _NUMBER_ Sportster 1200c. I'm near Dallas, TX. Looking for the following parts: * Clutch cover * Left rear turn signal * Left front turn signal * Master cyl rebuild kit * Caliper rebuild kit * Battery cover * Forward controls * Clutch lever * Clutch perch * Left mirror * Front engine mount bolt I could also be talked into some kind of seat solution that isn't the split seat with sissy that I currently have, but that's a low priority.
I bought a _NUMBER_ WRX in November _NUMBER_ with 88k miles for $16k. The mechanic near me wants $5k for head gasket and timing belt replacement at 103k miles. I've already spent about $ _NUMBER_ paying blood sucking morons at _NUMBER_ different Subaru dealerships to fail to diagnose the problem. Do you all recommend paying for the fix or selling this lemon and buying something else? I'm currently having extreme regrets about buying a used WRX. I'm now just barely shy of the price of a brand new one for a fucking _NUMBER_ year old vehicle that has been nothing hit disappointment after disappointment.
For those who don't know, the newer s60s do not come with a spare. In fact, there is not even a place to put one. Instead, they come with a Continental Mobility Kit , which is like an advanced version of fix-a-flat. So here is the deal, I ran over a nail or something similar and punctured the tire. The nail seemed to stay behind. When the tire got low, I pulled into a parking lot. I could hear the air escaping the tire and I easily found the puncture spot. The hole is perfect for a plug. I first called Volvo Roadside Assistance (which I have since my car is under warranty still) I hoped the tow truck could either plug the hole or take me somewhere where I could get it fixed. The guy on the phone informed me that they only thing they could do is install MY spare (which does not exist) or tow my car to the already closed Volvo dealership, leaving me stranded until morning. In reality, Volvo Roadside Assistance is no assistance after business hours. Worthless. I really did not want to use the mobility kit, but I was out of choices. I was _NUMBER_ miles from my home and near nothing open. I had few choices. I hooked the mobility kit up and ran the compressor. It sealed the tire, but it is supposed to be fixed (sealer is only temporary emergency fix) within _NUMBER_ miles. The sealer is latex based. I am assuming I need to go to a tire place to get all of the stuff cleaned out of the tire before getting the tire repaired. How does this stuff affect the TPMS sensor? Is there anything else that I should do? I will be adding a tire plug kit to my trunk after this experience. I need to replace the "mobility kit," but it is kinda pricey. Will a can of Slime be as good? tl;dr. Used tire sealer that came with car, Volvo roadside assistance is completely useless.
I've been told to not let the car sit over _NUMBER_ RPM for the first _NUMBER_ miles is this true? Just wondering because being in sports and sport plus mode the pdk revs it higher before shifting? So, I guess I stay in normal mode or paddle it to maintain under _NUMBER_ RPM? I would love to hear your thoughts on this. Furthermore, any other tips for caring for the car other than standard maintenance. I think I am going to get the XPEL coating as well thoughts? I will post pics I pick it up in _NUMBER_ days! EDIT: _NUMBER_ Cayman GTS
I'm trying to nail down an issue with my _NUMBER_ Chevy Volt that I was wondering if anyone else had observed. It's pretty small potatoes in the grand scheme of things, but as I have to bring the car in for some work (Onstar module replacement, a recall, turn signal doesn't automatically turn off), I thought I'd see if this was a fixable issue. What happens is that on the display, the artist and title information for a particular song will often stop after the first sixteen characters. Sometimes the information shows up fine, and sometimes the characters will take ~ _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ seconds to fill in. Once in a while I get some hilarious abbreviations. I've put pictures of this issue happening here: _URL_ I've tried refreshing the signal to the car, and it doesn't help. I've called SiriusXM about this, and based on what I've described to them, the technician I talked to agreed that something's not right and the receiver should be replaced. However, when I mentioned the issue to my dealer, I was told it was all due to SiriusXM's signal and that they would not pursue it. Lots of finger-pointing. I've written as well to whatever the equivalent of the Volt Advisor is now, but as I wait for their response, it'd be good to find out if this is an issue specific to my car, or if it's something that other people see. Finally, basic googling shows this issue sometimes happens with other models off and on as well, so if this is how the technology operates, that's fine it'd just be good to know either way.
Sup peeps, Wanted to see if anyone had similar issues or knew it offhand. My Volvo S40 will randomly, usually while turning, lose all the electrical power for a few moments and then return to normal. I know this make/model has some issues with the electrical functions (As I've replaced my alternator in this car already) Does anyone have any insight? I've read other places is that a Fuel Pressure Sensor might be the cause. But I'm unsure.
edit: sorry misleading title looks like IS-F, meant IS- _NUMBER_ . Asking specifically about the _NUMBER_ F-Sport AWD IS _NUMBER_ . I'm not entirely sure the differences year to year but I'd really like to hear your thoughts, anything you think is pertinent to a prospective buyer. How is the infotainment, how are the headlights, etc etc. CHEERS
Let me attempt to convey how stupid I am. In the earlier troubleshooting thread, I was looking for what the standard operating voltage is between the black red wires on the UI controller. (I still am looking for this--anyone got a voltmeter and an opened printer case handy?) Re-flashing the LCD firmware turned out to solve my earlier problem. For a shining moment my printer was working. Great, I thought, now I can measure that voltage for myself, in case I need it later. I touched the multimeter probes across the black and red wires right at the connector, and--- The screen went dead. How odd, I thought, until I realized my multimeter had been left on a current setting, with practically a dead short across the probes. Ouch. So now I observe a black (but still backlit) screen, but with the bed pushed all the way back, the servos forcibly hold it in place. I've searched and found similar symptoms in other threads here--but the answer of unplugging and plugging back in doesn't work for me. Neither does the refresh-LCD-firmware process (both limit switches button held during power-on. The fan never spins at all.) Maybe try refreshing the motion controller firmware?? Stupid mistake, the kind I thought I learned as a teen. Protip: if you ever measure current, NEVER leave your meter set to that. And like before, I'll take any board-level troubleshooting hints anyone has. (And I still measure _NUMBER_ volts across red black)
I have reevaluated my situation and now plan to buy a Q3 instead of S3. The roads where I live in China are just not suitable for a car that has 120mm ground clearance. In China there are two _NUMBER_ options, 132kw and 162kw. Approximately _NUMBER_ USD price difference. Initially I will go stage II APR with intake and exhaust. Then I will get a K04. Stage II will give the same 285ps approx for both _NUMBER_ engines? With my plans mentioned above will it make a difference which _NUMBER_ engine I get? Will I be able to make the same 350ps approx for each engine with the K04 and other items? I would prefer an RSQ3 but those will be _NUMBER_ ,000USD in China!!!
I usually pump my own gas went to a new station cuz needed gas they pumped for me forgot to mention premium. Help. Edit: We Gucci bois, I just used my gas up for the week and refilled it to that sweet premium. Thanks for all the reply's. (You can stop now, but I do appreciate the effort that y'all make to help a fellow redditor out) P.S. my headlight is out, any suggestions on new/ different headlights to try out for better visibility or just stick with stock?
Hey guys, going to buy a new 4runner, and just wondering what trim package makes the most sense if I'm planning on doing the common upgrades (front and rear bumper, sliders, roof rack, icon suspension with a slight lift). Does it make sense to go with the the off-road or off-road premium? Or just SR5 4wd? What sort of features would I gain or lose by going with one over the other? What trim package did you get and how happy are you with it? Thanks guys!
Walked into VW yesterday and somehow walked out with a _NUMBER_ Jetta. I didn't want to pull the trigger for a few reasons but I thought I was getting a good deal now I'm wondering if I did... _NUMBER_ month/12k a year,$ _NUMBER_ monthly, $ _NUMBER_ down, $ _NUMBER_ security, $ _NUMBER_ for tax, DMV, bank fee etc.
Hey guys, I need help with a problem I have with my Audi, so what it does is when I drive up a hill or drive around with low RPMs the car would hesitate and the EPC light would turn on for the duration of the time it's hesitating, and once I give it a little gas, everything goes back to normal. The car also stalls sometimes when I drive with low RPMs, for example I was driving _NUMBER_ mph down the road at low RPMs, the car would slowly lose power, and the EPC light would turn on and if I try giving it gas, it doesn't do anything. The check engine light would also come on and I get a P0341 camshaft position sensor a circuit range/performance bank _NUMBER_ or single sensor and after I drive with the car a little the check engine light would go away.. What I have done so far is changed the camshaft position sensor and the crankshaft position sensor, changed one of the coils because it was bad, cleaned out the throttle body, cleaned the MAF sensor, and i don't know what else to do If anyone had this problem or knows what's going on, could give me a little hand or point me in the right direction, that would be great!! Thank you!! The car also has _NUMBER_ miles
Hey All, Looking to join the Harley family and have been on the look out for the _NUMBER_ and dynas. I found a _NUMBER_ dyna street bob with _NUMBER_ .5k miles in great shape for 9k. Based off other listings it looks like a great deal. Am I missing something, is 9k to much for a bike of this caliber. I understand this may seem like a silly question but would like to know the thoughts of you all. Thanks
So the _NUMBER_ I posted the other day came with some unknown mods, dealer just said that guy did some stuff to it. Well I discovered today that one of them was he set it up for remote start. It came with an aftermarket remote, and the alarm button primes the glow plugs, and then the trunk button starts the engine. It seems a bit finicky, once it ran completely remotely, another time it died as soon as I tried to put in into gear. Has anyone else done or seen this before? Are there any electrical issues I should worry about?
I just picked up a _NUMBER_ and am having fun trying to dial it in for my use. On the infotainment screen on the first page is a button for Pandora. "Pandora. Listen to everything that's close to what you WANT to listen to, but not that!TM" So, I'd like to swap it for Stitcher which I actually use. I can see how to move it on that page but am not seeing a way to move it to the second page (and Stitcher to the first). Secondly, I'm not subscribing to XM. Is there anyway to just hide all that content? Really enjoying the car though!
The charge port on my Model S clicks, but does not open. This just started this evening after the service center closed, but I know that it typically takes quite a while to get an appointment with them and I'm driving a long way tomorrow (I hope), so I really want to charge overnight. I've pressed the button on the screen in the car many times and I've clicked the button in the app. The almost always results in the port making the click noise that usually means that it's going to open, but it never results in it opening, at least not tonight. Does anyone have suggestions that does not include the phrase "could probably pry it open with a screwdriver"?
I think the bracket is called an intake chamber stay bracket. It connects to the intake manifold and below as well I think. It holds the transmission kickdown throttle cable as well as a fuel line (I think). Whoever worked on it didn't bother to replace the bolts so its floating being held up by the cables. Does anyone know what size bolts they are so I can buy some (or how I can find out)? SOLVED: M8x1.25 for the top bolt. M10x1.25 for the bottom (I think).
Hi all, I just purchased a _NUMBER_ Accent (hatchback). No issues with the car except that it didn't include the little cover that goes over the trunk in most hatchbacks. I spent about an hour searching the internet and came up with nothing. Now I'm starting to think maybe it never had one to begin with? Does anyone know if Accents come with a cargo cover, and if so, where I could find one online?
I am buying my own car, A CPO _NUMBER_ + Hyundai sonata sport _NUMBER_ .4L with premium and tech package. and less than _NUMBER_ miles. Im down to one a _NUMBER_ and the other a _NUMBER_ . Identical for about 17k. Prices differ about a few hundred dollars and mileage on both about 24k. On one of them the price went up online but ignore that. Car gurus says its over priced and so does my bank lady but no one will come down. Is it a good deal? Also do dealers not go below internet price? Links to both: _URL_ _URL_
Basically what the title says. I'll be getting a _NUMBER_ WRX base model later this year and I already know that the stock speakers and headunit are trash... Maybe moreso the headunit than speakers. What I'm wondering is if it's worth it to upgrade the speakers with the Kicker ones Subaru sells as an upgrade full package door speakers/tweeters/subwoofer if I also plan on upgrading the headunit to a GCS Apex V2 Android unit. Will they complement eachother well? Should I keep the stock speakers and just upgrade the headunit? Should I upgrade the headunit and get aftermarket speakers with an inline amplifier? So many questions! Thanks in advance!
I drive a _NUMBER_ wrangler sport and when I went to turn it on earlier tonight, the engine started just fine but the gauges didn't start up, or light up when I turned the interior lights on. The interior overhead light, the turn signals, and the high beams all wouldn't turn on either. And the windshield wipers were going like crazy even though they were supposedly off. Everything else worked fine, including the a/c, radio, and the rest of the lights. Could have even driven it if I really needed to. Bf's suggestion was to check the fuses but it doesn't look like any of them are blown. Any other ideas?
Just bought my first car (Second mazda though!), and somehow there is a small scratch in the leather in the back seat (nobody has even ridden in the back seat yet -.- ). Not the end of the world, but considering the fact that I'm more likely to put an item on the back seat than have some sit there, I'm strongly considering getting a seat cover. I really like the leather, and will probably leave the front seats as-is, but I'm just concerned about wear and tear. I know that I need something that accommodates airbags, and I know I want something that fits well I hate the look of baggy one size fits all covers. That's about all I know in terms of options though never driven a new enough car to justify covers, and I have no idea which brands fit well, are good quality etc. Price isn't a huge issue (obviously not spending thousands, but I'm ok with spending up to four or five hundred if need be), but I have no idea where to begin. Thanks in advance!
Anyone have any experience with these? Thinking about throwing a set on my Sportster. I like to explore and occasionally hit some dirt roads for camping and what not. Figure these will be better than the street tires Im running now. Plus they look cool and price is right.
After one issue after another, I've emailed Monoprice about replacing my printer. Just curious if any of you have any experience with this. I haven't done any permanent modifications, but I did have to replace a faulty thermistor in the heat block. The issue I'm having now is with the bed thermistor though, which from everything I can see, looks to be a lot more complicated of a fix. TBH, it's just more worth it to me to send it back rather than tinker around not knowing what I'm doing and potentially make things worse. Best case scenario, I get a V2 back, but even if not, I'm fine with a working V1. But I'm curious if my first thermistor replacement would void the warranty. I've looked over the fine print on the website, and I don't see anything explicitly saying that, especially since they are different parts. I kinda wish I could just order a new heat bed and install it myself. I would be fine with that option, but that doesn't seem to be available.
Looking for seat covers for a _NUMBER_ touring. I got the leatherette seats, which I've found does not mix well with sweaty bodies. I've been looking at neoprene covers, but really don't know if they would be more comfortable in the heat or not. Ease of cleaning is important also.
Hey guys. I'm currently looking to get a set of winter tires and wheels to drive my _NUMBER_ Ecoboost Premium this upcoming winter. Right now, I have the Pirelli _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ ZR20 99Y on my car, with 20x9 wheels. I've been going through tirerack and other sites and feel pretty comfortable choosing a set of Blizzak WS80 _NUMBER_ /50R18 with a set of whatever the cheapest set of rims on tirerack are that fit. Which appear to be the P3 Sport Edition 18x8. All in all, between tires, wheels, TPMs, and shipping it all comes to about $ _NUMBER_ . Considering the site is basically holding my hand through the selection process, I feel confident that these are all compatible options for me. I then decided to see what I could find on Craigslist. There I was able to find someone selling a set of Blizzak WS70 _NUMBER_ /50R18 on what appear to be OEM fanblade wheels(Seller doesn't know the dimensions of the wheels) off of his _NUMBER_ GT. Used for one winter and has _NUMBER_ miles on them. Selling for $ _NUMBER_ . I'm not knowledgeable when it comes to wheels, but I've been doing a bit of research on the topic. One of the concerns when choosing tires is that the offset can't be too different than what is designed for the car to prevent rubbing and that the brakes line up correctly. There appear to be slight variations in dimensions for what works between the various generations of Mustangs, and I'm not sure if this is compatible. Will this used set work with my Mustang? And if so, would it the cost benefit of the used ones outweigh spending the extra $ _NUMBER_ to get a completely new set. Thanks EDIT: As an update. I was able to find out a bit more about the wheels from Craigslist. They're stock wheels that were bought new that are for a _NUMBER_ GT with order code 64E. EDIT _NUMBER_ : After calling a ford service center, I've gotten confirmation that the _NUMBER_ wheels won't clear the rims on mine. So, Tirerack it is.
Hey guys, wondering if anyone has removed the plastic valance on the front bumper. I know how to do it, but I'm curious if there's any issues. The radiator looks more exposed with it, but otherwise I can't see anything else. I think it would look better and give a bit better of an approach angle with it removed. I'll be making a front bumper at some point, but for now I'm looking at something quick and easy. Thoughts?
I would like to purchase a couple of printers for my classroom to expose my kids to 3D printing. I have already printed lots of things for the classroom and I would like to have my kids see how the process works. My principal has already told me that they would front the money to buy tow printers. So, the question is which printer should I buy. Should I go ahead and get two Mini Select V2s, wait for the Mini Delta, or maybe get one of each? The Mini Delta forum is pretty dead so I am not sure how they turned out. Edited to add that these printers will be going into a 4th grade classroom.
ok so im still fairly new to the subaru life and looking for some suggestions for my car. So far i have a downpipe/exhaust and an accessport. I know the next logical step would be a: Boost controller, intake and a tune and possibly some TVG deletes. Can anyone provide some parts they would suggest? Thanks?
I'm tired of the stock rims getting more and more beat up every time I have to swap tires, so I'm looking into getting an aftermarket set to put my summer tires on in the next month or two. According to the Subaru website the wheel specs for the Limited are 18x8.5 and the tire specs are _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ R18 (assuming the _NUMBER_ and 2017s are the same). Do I need any other information to ensure compatibility with both the car and the stock summer tires I already have? Where do you guys shop for wheels? I know Amazon has some but you kind of have to know in advance exactly what you're looking for. I have a budget in mind (<$ _NUMBER_ ) but I don't know what to expect to be able to find with it. I did some brief searching and it seems like everyone already just knows at least this much but I have never bought aftermarket wheels before and I really don't want to end up dropping this much money only to find out months later that they won't work.
We've noticed quite a few of you post photos or stories about the influence of your dad and thought it would be fun to put together a Father's Day Photo Contest. **The Rules Post a Dad-Related Harley Photo (your dad, your son, your dad's bike, etc.) then give a short caption on the story behind it or what it represents.** Top _NUMBER_ most upvoted by Monday at _NUMBER_ AM EST win either a pair of Biltwell Bantam Gloves , a Battery Tender Plus Charger or a $ _NUMBER_ credit to _URL_ . 1st place gets first choice, 2nd place next, 3rd what's leftover. Good luck! _______________________ Edit: Please submit contest entries to this thread and not a new one.
I'm in the market for the _NUMBER_ ES, but am curious what the competition looks like. Basically looking for a mid/full size sedan with fuel efficiency, price point ~$50k (+/- $10k) and reliability. I am not sure if any other car on the market has all of the above? Am I missing some?
This is a _NUMBER_ Saab _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ .3t, previous owner paid $ _NUMBER_ for a shop to replace the turbo (yeah....), anyway I had an issue with the boost gauge fluttering under load. I hooked up my Tech _NUMBER_ and it couldn't read MAP pressure fast enough to see what was going on So I disconnected the APC and read the base boost, it was set to about 1psi, so clearly the wastegate actuator needed adjustment. I took one off another _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ and matched the length and reinstalled, but now my gauge is slamming into the red before coming back down and my base boost is about 8psi. Is there some way to set this without trial and error? It's at least half an hour to adjust each time
I have an _NUMBER_ Ford f- _NUMBER_ that I want to fix up and drive, as I like older trucks. When my parents got it forever ago, it had been converted from a _NUMBER_ on the tree to a floor shifter. The floor shifter constantly jams, so I want to convert it back to the column. Does anyone know what all this will entail? Any advice is appreciated, thanks.
So looks like I'm going to be in the market for a new bike coming up. Looking at _NUMBER_ different Dynas. One is a _NUMBER_ Wide Glide, _NUMBER_ ,xxx miles on it. The other is a _NUMBER_ Superglide. _NUMBER_ ,xxx miles. I like both bikes and both are in my price range, but I'm not sure which is the better choice. I like the idea of having mids on the superglide, but the lower miles on the wide glide is pretty appealing. Just not sure what the best move is to make. I really like the mid controls on my current sportster, but I have had forwards on bikes before and didn't mind too much. I'm just a bit shorter of a guy and I do prefer the mids I think. Perhaps I just need to slow down and not be in such a rush to get a new bike... It is winter after all.
So my cd changer keeps trying to change cds while the car is off, I don't know if there is a harness in that would allow me to just disconnect the cd changer completely but leave the unit on so I can use my aux. I tried pressing _NUMBER_ and _NUMBER_ than clearing the code, which seems to work until I turn the car back on, and currently am trying to disconnect the battery again and see if that works. It keeps killing my battery though and I'm not sure what really to do at this point. I have the shaker _NUMBER_ from my _NUMBER_ still and am considering changing them out, but idk if my subs would still work on it.
So I was driving my _NUMBER_ TDI Jetta home the other day and was hearing and feeling a loud pop in the front suspension whenever I hit a bump or accelerated hard or stopped hard. It was to the point of me almost parking it and having it towed! I gingerly drove it _NUMBER_ miles home and jacked the car up, looking and checking all the suspension components. Come to find out, a small rock had become lodged in between the lower suspension and the frame of the car on the drivers side! Took a hammer and punch, and knocked it out. Problem solved!
Noticed a small oil leak a week ago, took it into a trusted shop I've used many times and they had to put UV dye in the oil tank because they had trouble seeing exactly where it was coming from. Looks like its a small leak from the rear main seal and they said its a fair amount of work, about $ _NUMBER_ to fix in total. Not something I wanted to deal with right now with the holidays... Can I put this off for a while and just keep my eye on the oil level? Any ideas if putting some sort of oil sealant in to slow it down/fix it temp? When I do get it fixed is there anything else they should take a look at while all that stuff is torn out? Thanks guys.
I bought a _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ .3L Silverado a couple months ago and was wanting to put on a new exhaust. I know you can buy a GM Borla exhaust but was wanting a Borla ATAK or Flowmaster Super _NUMBER_ . Poking around forums, it seems Borla is okay? I'd like to not void the warranty if possible and still have a nice happy sound.
Sorry to test everyone's patience. So my _NUMBER_ Jetta SE is still intermittently stalling, starts fine cold, but later on once heated up will die randomly. No check engine light, and I just got it's OBD2 scanner read at autozone, and it's producing no codes. There's definitely something wrong though bc it can't go very far without the engine dying after so long. I thought for sure it's gonna be something wrong with the fuel pump, but wouldn't that lead to some OBD2 codes? If not some other kind of dashboard light warning. :( Edit: does anyone know where the fuel pump relay is on a _NUMBER_ Jetta _NUMBER_ .5L SE? The fusediagrams.com site doesn't seem to list it as existing, just the fuel pump's fuse. How would I figure out which one is the relay?
I am looking to buy an E60 M5 in the next month or two. I want to do as much research as possible for when I go out to test drive the vehicle. Is there an in depth buyers guide? Preferably videos but I'm not complaining. What are some common issues with the model and how can I diagnose them on the test drive? What year model should I look into? What kind of maintenance should I immediately do in order to increase the longevity of the vehicle? I am buying this vehicle for pleasure driving. Not a daily driver. I won't be taking it out to the tracks. I've been in love with this car since it came out. I currently drive an E60 535i. I wanted to familiarize myself with the model first before going on to the M5. Thanks in advance!
Since I just replaced my suspension, I went to my local garage for an adjustment. According to them, they can't do it because all my lower control arm's bushings and my inner tie rods are worn out and replacing them would cost me around _NUMBER_ $ CAD (Quebec, CA). Plus instead of replacing the bushings they recommended to change the whole arms. Now here is my problem: I'm a university student and I've just invested _NUMBER_ $ in suspensions, so I don't really have the money to do such repairs. My question is: Can't I really wait until next spring to make these repairs? and is it really as dangerous as they told me it is? Also I'm pretty manual and I love working on it myself, so I'm considering doing those repairs myself. (If it is safe/simple enough)
Hi all! Joining the club on Friday. Picking up a _NUMBER_ GT Hatch manual in Machine Grey. After some haggling got the dealer down to _NUMBER_ before tax, title and registration. This will be a nice step up from my _NUMBER_ F150 that gets 11mpg.... New tech, better mpg, better safety and a hell of a lot easier to park haha Im excited so thought I would share.
I'm considering a _NUMBER_ C4 or C4s to replace my WRX STi. i live at _NUMBER_ feet with a lot of snow and this will be a year round car, so snow tires in the winter. I'm wondering if the hp difference between the C4 and the C4s is significant enough for me to rule out a deal on a C4 living at this altitude? I can't really afford a turbo _NUMBER_ so i'm looking mainly at the C4.
About a month and a half ago I was in a little accident. I was stopped at an intersection. When light turned green I went straight. Car across from me was stopped. When I was about _NUMBER_ % of the way straight through he decided to start turning left. He hit my rear driver side wheel. Couldn't have been going more than _NUMBER_ mph. I had a Jeep mechanic look at it (not dealership). He did wheel balancing and alignment. Everything seemed fine. When I look at the tire when the Jeep is moving I can see it wobbling back and forth very slightly. I also hear a squeak when I put about _NUMBER_ % pressure on my brakes. If I brake harder the noise goes away. The squeak isn't a constant noise. If I keep the brake at _NUMBER_ %, the noise is intermittent and the speed depends on how fast or slow I am going. I'm going to bring it to another shop to see if they can find something. If the wheel was balanced, would the wobbling be cause by a tilted hub? Or could the tire be off slightly and the balancing machine couldn't detect the tire being off? What could cause that intermittent squeak only when I push on the brake pedal slightly?
I personally like the Lexus IS lineup. If I had $108K lying around I would get the Lexus GS F, as for some odd reason Lexus decided to skip out on the IS F lineup. Anyways, I'm debating on which new IS to get ( _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ model years). The 200t is nice and does not have the annoying hump that both the _NUMBER_ and _NUMBER_ have thanks to some odd way Lexus fitted the AWD system. Also here in Canada both _NUMBER_ and _NUMBER_ come as AWD, so no RWD is available without the hump, your only way is to go with the 200t, but 200t is bit lacking on power and that I4T would be working harder vs the _NUMBER_ .5L V6's in the _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ . So I'm kind of broken between the 200t and the _NUMBER_ . Frankly the $10K extra for the extra 50hp adjustable suspension in the _NUMBER_ pisses me off, as you can put air suspension in both the _NUMBER_ and _NUMBER_ and enjoy yourself. Suggestions and advices.
Good idea or bad idea? Just for visual purposes of course, as it makes the car so much nicer to look at. I read that the increase in weight would affect the car negatively since the the _NUMBER_ comes with _NUMBER_ inch tires and hubcaps. Would _NUMBER_ inch tires and rims be better suited for only the bigger engine _NUMBER_ ?
So long story short I own a _NUMBER_ WRX (CVT) purchased in Edmonton ' Canada . I live 350km away from there and I've always been back to the dealership to do my regular maintenance. I have 38k km on it so it's still fairly new . I decided that instead of driving it to the dealership I would go to a local one to get my oil changed. Well they ended up having no filters in stock this morning so I went back in , picked it up and drove back to work . This is where my trouble starts . I take it go back out . I got about 500m then I lose all power to the engine . Pull over shut it down and try to start it again . The engine revs up to _NUMBER_ Then down to 1k then _NUMBER_ and just shuts off . I looked at my oil levels and it's good but dark so obviously needs to be done . Check gas cap , looked over the engine to see if I could pick up on anything ( I'm not a mechanic by any stretch) and I couldn't find anything . I'm sad to say that it's now on a flatbed going back to Edmonton . Anyone know what could have gone wrong ?
Hi friends! So I'm looking to join the Wrangler community and I'm not sure what to do. I'm obsessed with the hypergreen color but all of the Jeep's in that color are basically brand new and all the $$$. I'm wondering if it would be worth it to buy a Jeep I can afford and have it painted? I have no experience with getting cars painted and I don't know what that would do to the cars value and whatnot. I also would still like a decently newer Jeep, I'm looking ' _NUMBER_ -'15s. Thoughts? Thanks in advance! PS. Sorry I'm on mobile and the formatting might suck.
I'm not sure if this is correct sub for this post if not my apologies. I'm looking to buy a _NUMBER_ softail slim black non-abs. I'm located in the chicago land area and was wondering what a good OTD price would be. I got some dealers to quote around 17k. The invoice price is around 13k, I think, and MSRP is $ _NUMBER_ . Is this a reasonable deal? Thanks!
hey Reddit, first time Subaru owner here and I can honestly say I'm in love. it's a _NUMBER_ impreza hatchback _NUMBER_ .5i now granted it's not a brand new car but it's the newest car I've owned and I love the fact it comes in Manuel transmission. I have so many things I want to add to it already and the list keeps growing, but I wanted to ask y'all where is a good place to start in terms of upgrades and/or after market parts? I know one of the first things I'd like to do is get a louder exhaust so I can get that famous subie rumble but what are y'alls thoughts? I'd love to hear them :)
So I've been thinking about this and wondering... I'm sitting at around 125k on my _NUMBER_ . I have thought that I heard a bit of that rice-in-a-can sound intermittently indicating that I might need to do the timing chain/guides/tensioners in the near future. I priced it out the best price I've gotten to do the whole job is $2k (including all new stuff labor everything... just to compare, VW wanted $3k) but I also have the option of going with a perfectly good low-mileage VIN/code matching replacement engine that can be had for less than the parts cost of the timing kit from a friend, before labor, that is. 125k mileage block with new timing? Or low-mileage replacement engine? Do the timing now? or run it until the timing goes drop in the new engine? Opinions?
I currently own a _NUMBER_ mustang that is equipped with a standard ford sync so no touch no navigation. Is it possible to upgrade to a newer ford sync replacing the system and all, and if so how much does it typically cost? Also do you guys think it's worth the hassle and money ?
I'm sure this is going to get a lot of hate on here, but _NUMBER_ % of WRX owners I see on the road are some of the most unfriendly people I've ever seen driving a car. Don't get me wrong the WRX is a solid car, I was going to buy one before I ended up getting a BRZ, but it's not great enough to warrant the sense of entitlement. Almost every time I give the thumbs up to someone in a WRX they either look at me like I'm in a rusty _NUMBER_ Honda Accord, or speed away to remind me how much faster their car is compared to my BRZ (because how else would I know right?). My only guess is that WRX owners are just salty that the BRZ took the spotlight as "Subaru's sports car". Anyway my rant is over, didn't know if you guys had any explanation to these angry Subaru owners
My wife and I just bought a VW Golf Mk6. She's complaining that she's too short for the car in particular, in order to fully depress the clutch, she says has to have the seat fully forward, which is uncomfortable and means she's too far forward for the brake. She's 155cm tall, or around _NUMBER_ foot. Her inseam (floor to crotch) is around _NUMBER_ cm, I think, floor to waist is around _NUMBER_ cm. (We previously had a VW Golf Mk4, and apparently that was better...? I thought the newer ones were most adjustable.) The car has adjustments for the seat (up/down, and back/forth), and the steering wheel (length and angle). My question is do any _NUMBER_ ' (or thereabouts) people drive VW Golf's here? If so, what sort of adjustments did you make? Any other tips you can suggest? (e.g. somebody mentioned a clutch stop?)
I've tried replacing a bunch of things on the fuel system, from the fuel pump to the fuel pressure sensor and everything in between. The starter's been replaced, the plugs, ignition and starter related fuses and relays were replaced as well and no luck. I'm pretty close to having to junk my beloved _NUMBER_ GLT but I don't want to just yet. _URL_
What I'm looking for: A blank plate to cover the hole after I remove the fog lights. I have _NUMBER_ 330xi with a broken driver's foglight, and in order to pass NH state inspection, it needs both fog lights working. However, the interior coating has fallen apart, bulb is toast, and lightbulb is corroded into place. Also, the wiring harness for that one foglight has been cut away, and will need to be replaced with a new harness. I don't want to do that until after the inspection. So... I'm looking for a blank plastic plate that would fill the hole left by the removed fog lights? I'm currently searching via Google, but want to post here to get more exposure as well. Here is a random picture of the same bumper/fog lights I'm talking about (not my car)
Hey everyone! Sorry if this has already been posted but I couldn't find an old post on it myself. I have a _NUMBER_ sport sedan and am not yet ready to spring for the very pricey nav. In the mean time, I want to mount my iPhone somewhere, but cannot decided on the best mount location in the cabin. What have you guys done? I am not a fan of the vent mounts, but the dash doesn't have much open space because of the display. Also, if anyone has some good $ _NUMBER_ -$ _NUMBER_ mount recommendations, it'd be appreciated. I am currently looking at the Scosche magnetic mount. Thanks!
is it possible to adjust the default settings for what the various buttons do? For example, there is a dedicated Navigation button that I dont use since I dont have Nav. Is it possible to adjust? Second, is it possible to adjust settings so that bluetooth connects easier/faster? Right now when I start my car, I have to select Audio/Media and scroll past AM/FM, Pandora (which I dont have), Sirius XM (dont have), and other softwares, before I can find my iPhone.
... waiting on the financing to go through. (EDIT: APPROVED!) Super excited to go pick it up tonight! First ever car purchase, and I am suuuuuper excited. I got a white, _NUMBER_ GS with a manual transmission. The whole experience was kind of crazy. For context, I am Canada so the prices are in Canadian. I went for some test drives of the GX, GS and GT today but the salesperson didn't seem to take me seriously and wouldn't budge on the sticker price. So I said no thanks, and walked out. When I got home, I called another dealer nearby and said, look, I know the invoice price is $ _NUMBER_ for the GS. Can you do _NUMBER_ ? The guy on the phone played hardball, but eventually took that to his manager and they agreed to that price. However, I had originally talked to another dealer, but in the next town over and he said that if I came out there he'd make it worth my while. So, I call him and tell him the offer I just got, and he offered to beat the price again and brought it down to a cool $ _NUMBER_ . I hope that's a good deal, cause this is my first car, and my first time negotiating. What do you guys think? Good deal, or average deal?
So, the Service Manual doesn't actually tell me the sizes of various bolts and such. I just discovered the clutch stuff is metric but until I open it up I've no idea what it is exactly. So, anyone know of a list of the sizes for the bolts and such so I'd know I need a 18mm for this, or a _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ for that and a _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ for this other thing over here? No, Ronnie's microfiche doesn't have the info. It only has a less enumerated list of diagrams from the service manual(s).
Hi, I have recently purchased Eono CA8163R for my _NUMBER_ Mazda _NUMBER_ , and i can not seem to get google assistant to work, it simply does not pick up any sound not matter what i try, my external mic is working correctly as i am able to make BT calls. Anyone faced this issue? have any advice ? (PS i checked with BT enabled and disabled in the google app.. same results)
So im a new owner of an _NUMBER_ ' s80! it got some work to it but i got it cheap so :) to the point: theres alot more s60's around than s80 in my area so what parts fits the s80? they look the same but im sure theres some difference? i was thinking of changing body panels and some stuff in the interior so :)
In my opinion the number of model _NUMBER_ sighting threads is getting really ridiculous and clogging up the front page of r/teslamotors. Not to mention the vanity posts about people who have ordered a car or other vanity posts like 'I had a Tesla birthday cake'. Currently ( _NUMBER_ hours ago) the top post in r/teslamotors is someone posting the plate for the car they have ordered. Can that post generate some actual fruitful discussion? I'm very dubious. My suggestion is that the mods rule these kinds of threads as superfluous and rule that all 'sightings' of nothing atypical be pushed into one post, perhaps the weekly experience threads. Currently no-one really does this and just posts their own new post. Often the front page of r/teslamotors is > _NUMBER_ % about a model _NUMBER_ seen in the wild or the order they just placed. R/teslamotors is a great place for discussion and when it's clogged up of these kinds of posts it loses it's value significantly. Good interesting discussions disappear and they lose depth and focus as people don't often go beyond the front page. Current Top _NUMBER_ Posts on r/teslamotors ( _NUMBER_ hours ago), and I'm paraphrasing the contents: * **Look at my plate** * **I detailed my Model X** * **I saw _NUMBER_ red Model _NUMBER_ 's today** * **Another Model _NUMBER_ was delivered** * Tesla Model S model added to GTA * **I saw a Model _NUMBER_ in Chicago** * Cars clogging up a supercharger * New Tesla Service Center picture * Jeremy Clarkson comments about self-driving * **I'm getting my Model _NUMBER_ in a month** * A Model S was modded into a wagon * Model _NUMBER_ config access first report. * **I ordered a Model _NUMBER_ ** * **I saw a Model _NUMBER_ ** * **I ordered a Model _NUMBER_ ** * **I had a Tesla birthday cake** * Model X on top of a restaurant * Model S changes over _NUMBER_ years * **Saw some Model _NUMBER_ 's at the Fremont carpark** * **Got my Model X today** * Supercharger nearly online * **Saw a Model X taxi** * Discussion on a revamped Model S's battery * **Got my Model S today** I've highlighted posts that I think fall into the category of Model _NUMBER_ sightings or vanity posts as of this minute. And they total _NUMBER_ of the top _NUMBER_ posts or _NUMBER_ % of posts. In my opinion this is valuable and lost real estate for good discussion about Tesla. &nbsp; Thoughts? &nbsp; &nbsp; Note: I'm posting this after finding my comment in the weekly Q&A thread was hardly seen, from the low replies in the weekly posts it looks like they get little visibility. And I think this is a relatively important discussion to be had. That comment was made _NUMBER_ hours before this one and so my observations were taken then.
I've owned my S60 for about four months now, yes... it's amazing! Went fully down the rabbit hole... Solar on the house, Level _NUMBER_ charger, Powerwall _NUMBER_ (install soon hopefully). The only time I've ever had "anxiety" was at the northern San Diego supercharger. I need to fill up to make it home to LA and couldn't charge anywhere else in range. We started the very cordial lining up process. Nods to other people as they drove in, shrugged and fell in line. Then in drove, let's say someone who wasn't "nice." No eye contact with the other cars waiting in line, and immediately took possession in a place clearly designed to jump on the nearest available charger. Hello anxiety... do I say something? Do I just wait for what was clearly going to happen and then say something? Do I let it go? Thankfully the next charger to open was directly in front of my car, so I didn't need to act, but this got me thinking. These cars are amazing pieces of tech, they know if your car connected to the supercharger is over it's free limit of charge and to be assessed a fee? They know when you car is idle and can send a message to your phone. What if they instituted a wait list program. Here's my thought: You pull up to a full supercharger location. A message pops up on your screen: "Get in line for next available charger?" Y/N After you press "Y" it shows the number of Teslas waiting in front of you. When it's your turn it tells you which stall "1B" to park at. Then when you connect your car to the charger, it only starts charging if your car was the one allotted that charger space. If you tried to move in on a charger without getting in line it would give you a message like "There is currently a line for charging, please vacate the charger and join the queue." I know this would be a real issue for ICEing spots but I think it would be something people would really appreciate. No more line that we all hope people will adhere to. Thoughts?
When I was _NUMBER_ I saved up $ _NUMBER_ and bought a skateboard, and a decade and a half later I saved up a bit more and made my second ever vehicle purchase: a ' _NUMBER_ TJ ( obligatory picture ). Jeep life has been absolutely wonderful, but I have a few questions: * It has HID headlights and fog lights, which both work fine, but the head lights are on when I think they should be off and vice versa. To clarify (where "knob" is the thingy to the left of the steering wheel you pull out, and "stick" is the stick coming out to the left of the steering wheel). Knob Stick Indicator light Result In in or neutral off all off In pulled out (i.e., to flash brights) on all of Out neutral off all on Out in on fog lights on; headlights off Out pulled out on fog lights on; headlights off In other words, when the indicator light for headlights (or is it brights?) is on, the headlights themselves are off, and when the indicators off and the knob is pulled out the headlights are on. This is confusing (I can get used to it though) and pretty awkward when I want to flash my lights at someone. What's going on; do you think I can fix it myself? * Also in the "strange electronics" department, sometimes the blinkers fail to turn on the first time and I have to turn them off and back on, or they blink really fast, or the flashers will only activate on one side of the car. Most of the time everything works fine, though, so it's not like one of the bulbs is burnt out. Any ideas on what's going on? * I usually can't start the engine unless I have the key in and turned at least halfway for three seconds. I pulled out my phone on the side of the road and found a forum post where people were blaming some...sensor? pump? something? that was mishandling the fuel pressure and should be replaced...but obviously I forget the details, and I can no longer find the same forum post. And my remote ignition setup starts it just fine with no drama. Any thoughts? * Do we trust the "shift into a higher gear now" light? * The center console has a lock, and after great effort I managed to get the key to actually turn it a quarter-turn clockwise and lock. But now the joke's on me because despite my best efforts I can't turn it back the other way to unlock it. Is this user error, or should I replace the lock? * Sometimes the gears grind when going into reverse (from a stop!). The previous owner said something about going into third to synchronize the gears and be ready for reverse, which I took to mean "floor the clutch, shift into third, slightly release the clutch, floor the clutch, shift into reverse", but that doesn't do anything. Have you heard of this technique? What am I doing wrong? * What are your recommendations for preventative maintenance / replacing fluids / etcetera? * The doors were stolen and replaced with junkyard doors by the previous owner (who also installed locks on the door hinges after that experience). He doesn't have a key for the new doors, though, so I've been leaving the not-sidewalk-side door unlocked on the streets of Chicago. Haven't had any problems yet (and I don't keep anything worth stealing in there anyway...and the rear windows unzip from the outside...), but I feel like it'd be prudent to get real locks anyway. Is my best course of action to buy these ? I saw a Youtube video of how to take the door apart and it seems straightforward enough. I just want to make sure I'm understanding the situation correctly and looking at the right part. Many thanks!
In the last episode I dispensed the wisdom of how to not clean your throttle body so it ruins your jeep. Today's lesson is "How to not install a CB antenna, so your trailer lights stop working". Prior to adding your CB antenna it is important to have working trailer lights. Otherwise, I can't guarantee that improper installation of your CB antenna will be the cause of the trailer lights not working, as was my case. It is also important to install your CB antenna just before a big road trip, and to also not re-check your trailer lights until right when you are planning to leave. The placement of your CB antenna mount is important to ensuring that your trailer lights stop working. It should be close to your driver's side tail light, so that reaching the bolts to tighten the mount requires you to remove the tail light assembly. And for convenience, disconnect the plugs to said tail light assembly. Here is the critical step. You must not mark the placement of the two electrical plugs to the tail light assembly. Next, insert the CB antenna mount bolts into the holes you had to drill in the back quarter panel, cut your knuckles on the many sharp edges Jeep has strategically placed inside the cavity behind the taillight assembly, and tighten the CB antenna mount completely. Now, when re-installing the taillight assembly, it is recommended to simply guess at which plug came from where. There are only two, so you have a _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ % chance of getting it right. Then tighten the two screws that hold the taillight assembly in place. Now, step back and marvel at your genius. Then forget what you have done (this is also crucial when it comes time to panic at what could possibly be the reason your trailer lights aren't working). I recommend on the morning of your big road trip to run late. Also, make sure it is an extremely hot day. Then load your entire family into your Jeep, before you hook up your trailer. I'm certain that you all have spotted my big error, and the reason for the trailer lights not working. When I finally figured it out I was blown away by not only my idiocy, but also by how easy of a mistake it was. The two plugs that go into the driver's side taillight assembly are identical. And as such, can easily be accidentally switched. So, if you find yourself in a situation where your trailer lights inexplicably stop working, check the connections to the driver's side taillight. edit: I should also mention that the weekend trip was a success despite the _NUMBER_ minute delayed start.
A family member of mine has a w209 (CLK550) and has been wanting to add bluetooth to their car. I found they have a V60 port in the center console of their car (Motorola CPT9000 port), but am having a little trouble finding somewhere to purchase a bluetooth adapter. I did find the port should work for BMW parts, but as you'd expect it is a little difficult to find optional parts for a now about _NUMBER_ year old car. Thank you.
People don't buy Mustangs for no reason, regardless of the powerhouse. I want to hear your story. I was born in _NUMBER_ , and I remember seeing the fox body everywhere when I was a child. I still liked them through my teenage years, but back in _NUMBER_ when Ford brought back the _NUMBER_ is when I started getting my panties wet. Back in _NUMBER_ I just got off work one day when I was stationed at Camp Lejeune and I saw a beautiful fox body in the resale lot on base, and I said to myself, "I ***need*** that, like right now". So I ended up buying it for $ _NUMBER_ . Let's just say it needed a **LOT** of work. Including the price, I have about $ _NUMBER_ in it. The exact fox body I bought is a numbers matching _NUMBER_ Ford Mustang GT with the last year of the carbureted _NUMBER_ Windsor. I had the motor rebuilt this past January. It has a forged crank, I-beam connecting rods, and pistons, along with a stage two Comp camshaft. Ported E7 heads, Edelbrock _NUMBER_ intake manifold, and a Holley _NUMBER_ Street Demon. I've done everything from what I posted above to (multiple) clutch cables, clutch pressure plate, motor mounts, and much much more. It even has air conditioning! Here's some pictures: _URL_ _URL_
Hello all, My wife had an unfortunate run-in with our garage and knocked the piece circled in the photo , but on the passenger side. I tried looking up the part to order a replacement, but I dont think this is correct- 57731AJ680 or 57731AJ71A . Can anyone help me identify the part and possibly a recommended place to order it online? It looks like its just snaps into place so as a complete noob, im hoping its a quick fix.
Here is the one I'm looking at Is it a pretty good deal? or should I work harder at dropping that price? It still has the factory warranty and they have some of their own that they will throw in for us, including detailing, lifetime drive train and paint warranty at no charge.
We are (and have been) having trouble with our car for and have been unable to find the cause until today. I figured I'd make a post here describing the trouble and what caused to maybe help out anyone else encountering the same problem. I myself was unable to find any useful information on this situation so here's hoping I can help others by providing it. The problem So our _NUMBER_ Santa Fe _NUMBER_ CRDi 2WD (diesel) has been having some problems caused the engine to stall at seemingly random moments. We brought it in for checkup at our local garage and they were unable to find out the cause of the problem. Lately the trouble got worse and worse: after a stall the engine wouldn't start for periods of time from _NUMBER_ minutes up to four hours. We were able to find an error code u0009 using an ODB II reader but no additional information pointed us to the actual cause of all the trouble. What we experienced (symptoms) _NUMBER_ . Sudden engine stalling at random times. Unrelated to speed, gear, outside or engine temperature and clutch usage (he have a manual transmission). _NUMBER_ . Car won't start at random times, sometimes for days. Spraying startpilot or brake disk cleaner into the air filter would help it start if it wouldn't otherwise. _NUMBER_ . No matter what gear, the engine would sometimes seem to shake or stutter for periods of time. More throttle seems to stop the shaking. _NUMBER_ . When driving in slow traffic on a warm day ( _NUMBER_ + C/ _NUMBER_ + F) the car would sometimes lose all power. You could push the pedal to the metal in first gear and only move 2mph for at least a few seconds until the car suddenly regains power and shoots forward all the while a huge cloud of thick, black smoke comes from the exhaust. What to look for _NUMBER_ . Is there enough pressure on the fuel line? If not check the fuel line and the fuel injectors. _NUMBER_ . Is the fuel filter clean? If the fuel filter is very dirty, empty and check the fuel tank for filth. **Do not attempt to drive the car on an (almost) empty tank**. You might damage the engine. _NUMBER_ . Is the EGR clean? If not, get it cleaned. _NUMBER_ . Are all glow plugs functioning? Replace them if not. This might fix your starting problems. _NUMBER_ . Is the battery healthy? Low voltage can cause error codes. Our case In our case one of the injectors and one of the glow plugs were broken. We replaced the glow plugs a few months before finding out the injector was broken as well. We had less trouble starting the car after replacing the plugs. Replacing a fuel injector isn't going to be cheap so save that option for last. All in all we've been driving around for almost over half a year with a can of startpilot (the only way to get the car started if all else fails) and today after another check the local garage found out that one of the injectors was broken and will have to be replaced. Finally something we can actually do something about!!
I was having a conversation with a friend of a friend about 4Runners. He asked if I had my lower ball joint replaced on my _NUMBER_ '. Apparently there was a recall I didn't know about. My _NUMBER_ ' has 240k miles. I bought it with 70k _NUMBER_ years ago. I've never taken it to a dealer for any kind of repair or maintenance. I've done the small stuff and a local shop has done the couple of bigger jobs (timing belt, axle seal). I ran my VIN through the Toyota Owners website and it came back with no maintenance records and this message: "*There are no open Safety Recalls or Special Service Campaigns for your vehicle.*" Does that mean I don't need it? or does it mean I missed it and I need to to care of it myself? Sorry if I sound like a dumbass, I've never dealt with a reacall on a vehicle before.
Going to be adopting _NUMBER_ Shiba Inu's in the next few weeks. I've been looking at accessories such as the rear barrier and seats covers but wanted to get some feedback if there were any brands that worked/fit better than others. Can't say I'm a fan of the hammock style rear seat covers but I'd love to hear any and all experiences. Would also like to know about other accessories that made travels easier as well. Thanks all!
Is it possible to swap the seats from a _NUMBER_ and up IS _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ into a _NUMBER_ IS _NUMBER_ or _NUMBER_ IS300? I've heard that the _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ has the same seat brackets as the _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ , but I'm not entirely sure. If I can swap the seats will the utilities be working for example the motor adjust, heating and cooling.
Hey guys, I've looked literally everywhere on the internet about wiring an active sub into my A4 but can't seem to find anything. Can I just cut the wires to the factory sub and connect it to the RCA wires on my active sub? If so, what cable do I need to use to join it up, I'm thinking standard speaker wire would overheat so how do i go about connecting it from the loom to the new sub? Sorry for the amateur question. I wired the same sub in my old Vectra without a problem but that had an aftermarket stereo. Thanks
The first few days things were printing perfectly and I was having very few issues. After a few days I started having this problem nearly every time I would print something. As the extruder is homing itself a little bit of filament will ooze out and be pushed onto the side of the extruder when it touches the build plate. This bit of filament will then stick to parts of the first layer of the print and pull it off the plate, or it will fall off and leave a big clump of filament stuck to the print. Anyone have any idea of how I can fix this? Thanks
So my brother-in-law is selling his _NUMBER_ 4Runner. He's literally washed it every week and taken very good care of it. 250kish miles but he told me it's starting to have torque converter issues. Anyway I have my main ride of a _NUMBER_ Sierra and I want to buy this one and fit it out to be a fishing/hunting vehicle for the beach down in Galveston, TX and deer hunting in the hill country. I can basically get this thing for the price of asking but where should I start to turn this into a hunting vehicle? Just curious what the standard lift/tires are. If the stock setup has enough engine or if the gears need to be changed for the bigger tires. Who makes a decent front/rear bumper with winch? I've never had a fun vehicle to run off road in so looking to enjoying turing this into a nice keep forever vehicle. Thanks for any tips I just don't even know where to start.
I have a _NUMBER_ Mazda3 S hatch. I drive it pretty hard, as such my front brakes are nearly ready for replacement at _NUMBER_ miles. The rear brakes are still doing fine. I want to upgrade my brakes to StopTech drilled/slotted rotors with PosiQuiet pads. StopTech makes a kit for the front but not the rear, so the rear would need to be purchased as individual components. Can I upgrade the front brakes and do the rear brakes at a later date or will this create a potentially dangerous situation by throwing off the brake balance?
What's up guys, after scrolling around the car market for a while, I think I want to get on the Honda Train. First off, I want to make one thing clear: I am NOT interested in making my Honda/Acura fast and super tuned out, nor am I interested in making the switch from Auto to Stick. What I AM interested in is making my car as sleek as possible through mods like new wheels, suspension, maybe some plastidip, and a nice exhaust. Which is recommended more, Accords or Civics and why? I really want to go with the coupe route with a sunroof. I like the sound of a "panda-esque" scheme, with a white paint job and black wheels, honda logo, etc. Is that chick magnet enough? If not, links to some ideas are always welcomed. Also, what kind of spoiler should I get if I get one at all? Again, no interest in racing or anything, I really just want to have something that's gonna make someone give a second look. How much should I spend for my first honda? When I finish college, I'll get a newer model (So ~ _NUMBER_ model), but I want something to get me started now. Does Honda make autos with paddle shifters? I don't think I would use them much, but I'm a fan of options should I ever want to use them. Any other ideas/suggestions are welcomed.
I'm exiting the Saab life. After many years and _NUMBER_ Saabs, I'm moving on. _NUMBER_ S _NUMBER_ door _NUMBER_ SE Coupe _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ SC Wife had: _NUMBER_ S vert _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ SE vert Yea...I like "GM Saabs". I should have kept my _NUMBER_ . I think I'm ready. I want something bigger and more modern. I'm an IT Guy, have all the toys, but not even BT in my car? (Yea, I have an aux BT adapter.... Fine for music, shit for phone). Re: bigger. My _NUMBER_ year old is tall. Freakishly tall. My wife is, too, though not freakishly. There is just not a ton of room in a Combi for rear passengers if tall people are up front. I want AWD. I thought about garaging my _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ . Just lease a new CUV. I'll never find a lower mileage Saab like it again. It's an amazing reliable car I've had no issues with. Although it shouldn't@ only 70k. But if I'm going to keep a 3rd Saab to fix up and tweak, I'd prefer an NG. Been in the Saab life a looking time. Not sure why I'm posting here. Y'all don't know me. I didn't even know there was a Saab /r (of course there is). Recently gotten into Reddit since they've finally made an official app. I read pages of Saab posts and wish I had hung out here. ;) Easy to do it here on mobile. I'll probably copy/paste this to SaabCentral (where I was a mod for years). Just wanted to get it all out somewhere.....
My Wife and I drive two Pilots and an Odyssey today. _NUMBER_ Pilot EX\-L AWD with RES my favorite. I liked the feel of the ride and shift of the transmission best in this one. _NUMBER_ Pilot Touring FWD her favorite, not mine. I found the transmission to shift awkwardly and I've read a lot of complaints about the _NUMBER_ \-speed. I also felt the ride to be rougher than the EX\-L. She likes the Sensing system which I find to be a bit of a waste, but it will be her car. Her current _NUMBER_ Toyota Sienna van can play from an SD card which the kids like, although the folder navigation is only something a Linux guru would love \(no offense there, it's complicated\). It's hard to tell if the wifi in the car would pickup a wifi connected hard drive like one of the WD models, or can it play from a connected thumb drive? _NUMBER_ Odyssey Elite They didn't have any Tourings on the lot, this thing was awesome, but just too much money. I was all about the Pilot, but the _NUMBER_ \-speed transmission has me a bit worried and I didn't like the ride on the FWD either. Anyone have input on these items and the RES questions? I'm having her reconsider the Highlander, but it seems you get more for your money with the Honda. Kind of wish she would also consider the new Subaru Ascent.
Hey guys, I am looking to buy an e46 BMW m3 within the next couple of months and was wondering what I should expect when owning one. I am aware of all of the issues regarding the SMG pumps, faulty rod bearings, and cracked subframes. I just mainly want to know the _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ /quarter mile times for the car as well as how much I can expect to spend on routine maintenance. I am debating whether or not to just take it to a professional or just do all my own maintenance (I am new to working on cars). I also would like some suggestions on the best tunes, exhausts, intakes, and body mods to add to the car (no particular budget restrictions as of now). Thanks!
My second car was a _NUMBER_ Volvo S70. This was two years ago so the car was already an old car. Repairs eventually got too expensive and I had to get rid of it. I've driven new cars recently and my _NUMBER_ S70 honestly still remains my favorite car to drive. I currently drive a _NUMBER_ Honda Civic that is embarrassing, old, makes strange noises, and is just ready to be put to rest. I'm considering getting a used _NUMBER_ S60 but don't want to make a decision that I'll regret. Here's the price that they are running for in my area: _URL_ Should I make the purchase? Should I expect headaches and expensive repairs? I'm a fairly young professional with a good steady job but still, I prefer to spend my money elsewhere instead of on repairs.
Hey guys. I didn't quite know where to ask this question so hopefully someone here can help me out or point me in the right direction. I use a energizer 500w power inverter in my work truck. ( _NUMBER_ chevy silverado ) basically what is happening is if I plug it in while the truck is running I get the red fault light. If I turn the ignition off then back on then it comes up with the blue normal light. But then if I turn the inverter off then back on it comes back with a red fault light. Anyone know what might cause this? It's a little annoying. I just had the 12v plug replaced because it wasn't working at all. But now it is doing this. Which isn't horrible but I just kind of find it odd. I use it to charge a laptop. Thanks for any help
A little background: _NUMBER_ ) Micro SD card changed name (from PRINTER to quality_ca) after ejection (yes, selected "eject") and lost all original files _NUMBER_ ) I moved _NUMBER_ files ("a" and "b") from previously saved desktop folder to the SD card _NUMBER_ ) selected "a" to print and it started printing "b". Assuming I selected "b", I cancelled print _NUMBER_ ) Selected "a" again and it still printed "b" _NUMBER_ ) I added _NUMBER_ more files ("c", "d", "e") to the SD card all files show up when I select print. Whatever I select, it prints the one below it ex: If I select "b" it prints "c", if I select "e" it doesn't print at all (nothing below it) Format card? This happen to anyone else?
My auxiliary fan on my _NUMBER_ bmw 540i has died, and I have a mishimoto fan lying around. Is it possible to wire the old _NUMBER_ wire connector to the new _NUMBER_ wire fan without it being on constantly? It seems brown is ground, black is constant power, and a small yellow/red wire is what I assumed was to monitor the fan speed, or for PWM. I've gotten mixed answers on the yello/red wire. I'm drawing a blank here. Edit: Solved
I'll have about a $ _NUMBER_ budget in a couple months, is there a major difference between the earlier years ( _NUMBER_ ) and the later ones ( _NUMBER_ )? Is there a best year? Looking to get the _NUMBER_ .3L version, upgrading from a _NUMBER_ Corolla _NUMBER_ .6L and I want that extra kick. Thanks :)
I have now put about 1k miles on my new Mercedes and have a bit of insight for those interested in something similar. First the good. The gears shift both up and down very quickly and right when I ask it to. The shifts are smooth and even under heavy acceleration don't slam into the gears like im used to American cars doing. The exhaust is intoxicating. I find myself changing gears for no damn reason other than to hear the backfires and burps. Im in love with the exterior but im head over heals with the interior. In fact its the reason I first fell in love with the C class. The quality of everything I touch is beyond expectations. I find myself slowly entering and exiting the vehicle to preserve its fine interior. It looks like a work of art. The infotainment is fine. There are things I would improve but I can easily get to what I need while driving without taking too much of my attention away from the road. The dynamic cruise control is awesome. My wife's _NUMBER_ Audi is manic and constantly slamming on the brakes. This one gets manic from time to time but for the most part is very smart. If I am in the right lane and someone passes me then quickly jumps into my lane, the car senses that the other car is going faster and even though it is entirely too close to me, will not bother slowing down. Also if im being slowed by a car in front of me and I signal to pass them, the car starts accelerating right when I signal. Even though I am still behind that car. Thats one thing that bugs me about the Audi, it waits for you to completely change lanes, then it ponders the meaning of life, by now you have traffic behind you, then it slams you into your seat as it accelerates. The bad. The only thing I can say is actually bad about the car is the lane assist. Its garbage compared to my wife's Audi S3. It bounces back and forth between lines and then complains when it lets itself cross the line and brakes in order to correct its own mistake and yells at me for what it did. It attempts to make me take every single exit. To be honest, im a bit surprised in just how unrefined it is. I expected more from Mercedes. The auto stop/start feature to save fuel is not as smart as I would have liked. I find myself having to shut if off when in traffic and coming up on a stop sign. It's fine if you're the first to get caught at a red light but anything less it just seems like im one start closer to having to replace the starter. Don't get me wrong, its quick. Sometimes I don't even notice it. It just seems unnecessary, specially considering it is on by default every single time you start the car. Other than that, I would say the exhaust is at about a volume of _NUMBER_ and I wish it were closer to _NUMBER_ . From the videos I've seen of the C43 AMG, it appears that they fixed that. After its first wash Let me know if you have any specific questions and I will do what I can to answer them.
I bought some _NUMBER_ " gold BBS wheels for my my _NUMBER_ . They fit on properly but rub on the rear fenders. What would be the easiest way to fix this issue. I tried rolling the inside of the fenders. Do I need to buy rear coilovers and raise the suspension? If so any recommendations for a coilovers set on the cheap end?
I had to take my car to the dealership to take a look at my car because it wasn't starting. They quoted me $ _NUMBER_ + to repair the starter. That that seem right? I think it seems very high. They also came up with a bunch of other things they wanted to do to the car, but I told them that I couldn't afford all those and just to focus on getting my vehicle started. But I'm very hesistent to pay that high of a price to replace a starter. And they even said it was a "used" one, but they gave it a different name, I guess to make it official or guaranteed. Anyways, I don't know. I'm having second thoughts. What do you guys think?
Hello All! I've seen a couple posts similar to this after searching, but none that answered all of my specific questions. I hope this is okay. Background information: I'm seriously considering purchasing a new Model X. I'm an investor and have an early reservation (30K) for the Model _NUMBER_ , but I have my first child on the way and my business is doing better than I could have anticipated. The X is now looking like something I can swing and would be a better vehicle for wife/dog/child trips. I live in East Harlem and park my current car in a garage near where I live. The place doesn't have charging, but there is another nearby lot that purports to have charging. I primarily use my car to travel back and forth between northern CT and Southern New Hampshire and the city. I do not use my car in the city. Specific questions: _NUMBER_ ) Has anyone used autopilot leaving the city? How good is it in the type of traffic you regularly encounter getting in and out of NYC? I test drove in Westchester and its just not the same. _NUMBER_ ) How packed are the supercharger stations along I- _NUMBER_ ? I see that there are several there and while that isn't my preferred route (typically), I'd go that way for charging. _NUMBER_ ) Does anyone in NYC want to act as a referral? (I believe this has benefits for both parties, but I'm not sure) The salesperson told me that he could connect me with a referral to be eligible for the free supercharging if needed. _NUMBER_ ) Does anyone have any experience with the parking services that are outside the city (typically Queens) that bring you your car when you need it and have charging stations? Since my trips are always planned and lengthy, I was thinking this could be a viable option, but wanted to know if anyone had any experiences with these services. Thanks in advance for any information or comments.
Hey, all! I just purchased a used _NUMBER_ Volt this weekend and love it so far! I have charged a couple times using the portable EVSE at _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ amps but today I discovered that the 240v charging stations at my office are free of charge. I hooked up to it but as I got to my office, I realized that I had it set to the default _NUMBER_ amps. I'm wondering if the Volt senses the 240v charger and overrides that restriction? I can't find this info in the manual or other forums!
Edit: After some online researching, maybe it will make a difference if I clarify that I'm buying this Tucson from a Hertz dealer....so it's a rental car. And the extended warranty is not through Hyundai, but a company called "Fidelity Warranty". Does that change any opinions? Hello...I'm looking at a _NUMBER_ Tucson SE with _NUMBER_ miles. Great looking car...rides great...looks like the perfect car for me. $ _NUMBER_ after tax and tag and everything. My question is, should I pay $ _NUMBER_ more for the extended warranty? It's a bumper to bumper coverage for _NUMBER_ years or _NUMBER_ added miles. Which would take the car to _NUMBER_ miles. Opinions? Thank you.
I'm the kind of owner that if something doesn't happen _NUMBER_ times, I write it off as a fluke and go on with my life. But I was at a local Home Depot and when I returned to the S, the key fob would absolutely not work. Side of car, front of car, behind car, buttons pushed, nothing. It was like the fob was completely dead, and it had a battery only a week old. So I took a video that lasted about _NUMBER_ seconds, of me ridiculously waving the fob around the car like Harry Potter and the Unresponsive Tesla. And finally placed the fob on the secret windshield spot; which took about _NUMBER_ seconds before the doors released. Then off to my trusty service center for an opinion. They said, "Was it the Home Depot on such-and-such?" To which I replied, "Yes.....". It appears that either an over-zealous cell tower that happened to have AM as well as cellular and/or the wireless security system (sensors or cellular paging) might have been the culprit to drowning out the ~300mhz spectrum. To which they rattled off about _NUMBER_ locations in my city that have similar problems, most with readily noticeable antenna arrays nearby. So, all that to say, if your FOB stops working, it might actually be an environmental cause and you should immediately switch to your app until you are out of that area. And you can verify this with your service center because they've probably seen it before. Obviously this does not apply to Model _NUMBER_ (keycard?) or Model X (Bluetooth-ish).
I live in the midwest and t4r's arent all that common compared to other places so when i see one, i notice it. 3rd gens pretty much glow to me so i can spot them in the dark with half a jag on from a mile away. Just wondering if 5th gen owners see us in our 3rd gens (or earlier) and give a mental nod of approval lol. Anybody else know what i mean?
I don't have any photos at this time. It's a _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ DL sedan with the _NUMBER_ Litre, _NUMBER_ cylinder gasoline engine and automatic transmission. It's been a one owner car from its purchase in _NUMBER_ to this week, when I bought it. If you have any questions please feel free to ask! Excited about joining the club, as it were. EDIT: The engine is a _NUMBER_ Litre, not _NUMBER_ .
While waiting on my Prusa i3 MK3 I decided to pick up the MPSelectMini v2.... wow. Coming off a year of bashing my head against a Tiko to get it to print anything at all I wasn't expecting much from a $ _NUMBER_ machine, so I find myself so surprised that I'm half tempted to cancel my Prusa (only half tempted.. that thing looks SOOO nice). Anyhow I've been really happy with my prints but have been making small mods here and there and really wanted to switch to a glass bed. I had a pane of glass cut to size at a local hardware store, cut the corners myself to match the template, added layers of tape to the front at back of the bed to bring it level with the buildtak, and added small binder clips to hold the whole thing together, installed a z-spacer. Problem is I can't get reliable bed adhesion no matter how I level it. After nearly a dozen failed prints I had one that seemed to be sticking and it was trucking along for an hour or so when one of the components popped off the glass. Does anyone have idea what I could be missing?
I was just going to go NEMA14- _NUMBER_ for my Tesla, but am now second guessing and maybe going HPWC. I noticed there is a rev2.0 and a rev2.5 product Anyone know what the differences are? I have seen a few rev2.0 and rev2.5 products on eBay am I nuts buying one from eBay instead of direct from Tesla?
I just recently bought myself a brand new _NUMBER_ 4runner SR5 (instantly in love), but am thinking about upgrading the tires and rims. Some black rims would really enhance the look of my new baby. In an effort to save some money for this upgrade, I thought it would be a decent idea to try and sell the stock tires and rims. Hopefully cut the total cost of the new setup in half. Any advice as to where/who I could sell the stock wheels to?
Are the plastic door frames required (roof frame locking clips attach to them) to put the soft top up? ( _NUMBER_ JK Sport 2dr) I left them at home the other day and it was gonna rain, so I put the roof up, but it seems to leave a _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ " gap along the top of the windshield.
Looking for some input on if I should commit. Here's the numbers: LEASE (36mo/ _NUMBER_ ,000mi) _NUMBER_ Hyundai Ioniq Limited $ _NUMBER_ down $ _NUMBER_ /mo $ _NUMBER_ purchase at lease end This includes a $1k credit for switching from Toyota and a trade-in of my Prius, valued (generously) at ~$2k. The numbers are pretty much exactly where I'd like them to be, though I'd obviously not take issue with them being lower. The dealership seems incredibly eager to make the sale as they've been consistently dropping the price each day. I'd be coming from a _NUMBER_ Toyota Prius, which I love. I'd like my next car to be as reliable and last as long as this car has, so I'm definitely intent on purchasing it once the lease ends. I loved the Ioniq on paper but after test driving it I found the UI and controls of the digital interface to be quite unintuitive. That would probably be my only reservation at this point. However, I've recently test-driven a used Lexus CT 200h and absolutely loved the interior and controls. Granted, it's a glorified Prius in most ways but after spending the past _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ years comfortably in a Prius I think that car may be exactly what I'm looking for. The price on the Lexus would be roughly $6k less all told. Any input is greatly appreciated.
I'm in the market for a second car, the wife stole my Volvo s60, and the 328d is floating to the top of the list. Used 2014s seem to be the sweet spot for price. Why shouldn't I get one? What compression gremlins are hiding in that little engine to steal my wallet?
I found a decent truck down the street from me. _NUMBER_ 4x4 Limited Natural White 4runner. 285k miles _NUMBER_ owner. all highway miles. They want _NUMBER_ $ which includes TTL. This truck looks clean except for the valve covers leaking oil. My question is what is the first thing you would do with this truck aside from catching up on the maintenence and fixing the valve covers. I plan on doing the water pump and timing belt at my shop and all the maintenance. I will be taking this truck to Colorado in about a month and will be living at a ski resort from November through April. The truck does need new tires. Do all terrain tires handle well in the snow if I get brand new Toyo At2s? What would you do to make sure this vehicle is ready for the winter assuming everything is stock. Thanks all for the input.
Good morning to you all, first time poster to this sub. I'm currently eyeballing a fairly low mileage ( _NUMBER_ KM/approx. _NUMBER_ miles) _NUMBER_ S6 that looks pretty clean, though it's coming from a non-Audi dealership. It's got a very fair price on it. I know some FSI engines have issues with carbon build-ups, probably tenfold for the V10. However I'm mostly hearing about it being bad on _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ S6s and I can't find anything on 2010s. Does anybody know if the carbon build-up is as much of a problem on later MYs? Anyone else know of any other common issues to look out for with these beasts? I've heard other than carbon build-up related issues they are pretty bulletproof and a ton of fun. It's either that or save my pennies for a _NUMBER_ A7. All opinions appreciated!
Hello folks! Long story short: I am _NUMBER_ yo and got money to buy my second car and I just fell in love with CLS I (C219) _NUMBER_ , _NUMBER_ .5AT 272hp _NUMBER_ 145000km. What would you advice? What problems may I encounter and what I should be ready for? Do you have similar experience and what is your opinion? Please, I am eager to hear your opinions. Thank you in advance!
I was searching around on Google for some mods for my non-turbo Mazda _NUMBER_ , but I always come across parts for the speed _NUMBER_ . I recently picked up the car and want to do some basic mods such as, intake an exhaust. Can I just buy speed _NUMBER_ parts and put them on a non turbo _NUMBER_ ? Or are they completely different platforms. Some information would be helpful, thanks in advance.
I've been looking for sub $15k sports cars like the mx- _NUMBER_ and mr2s recently and am wondering how they compare to the boxster as a daily driver? I'm looking for a reliable fun daily driver for the Pacific Northwest. I commute about _NUMBER_ miles each way and currently have a gen _NUMBER_ mazda _NUMBER_ that I'd give to my spouse. I'm wondering how much more maintenance would cost over a miata or mr2 spyder and what kind of performance difference I'd see?
Hey guys, I picked up a set of wind/rain deflectors from the dealer today, and I'm not sure if they fit as well as they should. The front pair fit normally, but the rear required a lot of negotiation to sit correctly. It feels like it's slightly too long, and the piece bulges out much farther than the front deflector. This is on a _NUMBER_ Golf. Have a look: _URL_ _URL_ If this is just how it's supposed to be, I can get over it, but it felt wrong bending it to fit. So does this look right to you? Just a byproduct of cross year compatibility?
I just bought a new _NUMBER_ Accord back in January. It has less than _NUMBER_ miles on it. I was driving across a bridge recently when the low tire pressure light came on. No biggie, I brought it to the gas station and filled each tire to _NUMBER_ PSI as specified in the door jamb. I then recalibrated the TPMS system and the light went off. I drove about _NUMBER_ miles and the light came back on. At this point, should I bring the car in to be checked? If one of the sensors needs to be replaced, is this covered by the _NUMBER_ year/36k warranty?
i uploaded to imgur and got tons of negativity on my big rims. Thought we should respect each other's unique tastes and just enjoy the vehicles. But I guess it's all elitist off-roaders. No wonder nobody wants to wave anymore. -edit: just to clear this up. I'm not here for validation. I totally understand people won't like my jeep. I just felt shitty because it seems that I'm unwelcome.
So, after getting my second V1, out of the box I was able to print my White Queen from the chess set I had been printing on my original. Queen printed fine, despite using a spool of Inland PLA that had been sitting open for the better part of a year. Then I had some bed surface and bed leveling issues and got those worked out. Back to printing, but every time I try now, the filament sometimes extrudes fine, and sometimes is little globs of pla about the diameter of the extruded layer. I've let prints run a while and they're completely structurally useless. I've run the nozzle at _NUMBER_ + empty to let any jammed filament melt off. The questions is: Stale PLA, clogged nozzle, or both? **Update**: Definitely a clogged nozzle, as a brand new roll of filament produced the exact same result.
I've been looking for an e46 _NUMBER_ post-facelift manual for several months now, and have not had luck with finding many that are in my state (Tennessee). I've looked on bimmerforums, Zhp mafia, Craigslist, Autotrader, cars.com, and ebay. Anyone else know of another source to find these cars?
Hi all, I'm hoping to get your input/suggestions on adding a back up camera for my _NUMBER_ Silverado work truck. I love my truck but it's basic all around so there isn't a fancy back up camera. All that being said my wife and I recently purchased a _NUMBER_ ' travel trailer and she is terrible with directing me appropriately to hook up to the trailer and to tell me the distance I am away from the back of a camping spot. Have any of you purchased a backup camera for their truck and have any suggestions or tips to bear in mind when looking around for this? The perfect scenario would be for me to be able to use a camera for both the back of the truck and the back of the camper. Thanks in advance for the info!
Wondering what to look for on this car when test driving/checking it over. The seller runs an auto repair place that works on MB, BMW, Volvo etc and has maintained this car for the last _NUMBER_ years. The prev owners upgraded to a new car and sold this 300td to the mechanic. 223k miles AC Works Antenna doesnt retract, sun roof doesn't open but is sealed. It apparently still 'clicks' though... exterior and Interior seems clean, checked VIN and no accidents reported Seller is asking $ _NUMBER_ the car has been listed for over a month Things I will be checking: rust under wheel wells and jack location, head number, hydraulic rear suspension Thanks!
Been feeling a bit dissatisfied with the stock shifter on my _NUMBER_ Mustang GT (S550 with the MT82 transmission). Haven't missed many shifts, but the sloppiness is evident and the two that I've missed were really infuriating. I find myself wondering whether to go straight to the MGW Race Spec (which seems to be the gold standard solution to this dissatisfaction), or to instead incrementally upgrade different parts that will get the best performance out of the stock shifter. Maybe I'll have to look into warranty implications of upgrading to MGW anyone have thoughts on this? Basically, the way I see it I have _NUMBER_ options. **Option _NUMBER_ : improve stock shifter assembly attachment to the chassis and remove any play in the stock trans mount** Steeda Shifter Base Bushing $ _NUMBER_ Whiteline Positive Shift Transmission Mount Bushing Insert $ _NUMBER_ *Total -* $ _NUMBER_ *Concerns with this option*: is this a stop-gap? a half-measure? Will the performance improvements be so imperceptible that I end up wanting more? Upgrading to options _NUMBER_ and _NUMBER_ make the $ _NUMBER_ shifter base bushing purchase obsolete. This does seem like the option that would be friendliest on the warranty, since the modifications are minimal. Some people seem to have a great experience with these budget-friendly modifications (such as this guy ) whereas other people (such as this other guy ) wasn't content with the improvement from the bracket bushing upgrade although he also concurrently upgraded to a Barton shifter, so it's not apples-to-apples. **Option _NUMBER_ : attach stock shifter assembly to the trans** Blowfish Shifter Support Bracket $ _NUMBER_ *Total -* $ _NUMBER_ *Concerns with this option*: this other guy linked above said it caused really excessive NVH. Seems like a weird middle ground that is good only if you are really attached or fond of the stock shifter and want to give it the sort of trans-mounted solid feeling that the aftermarket ones have. **Option _NUMBER_ : get trans attached MGW shifter** MGW Race Spec Short Throw Shifter $ _NUMBER_ *Total -* $ _NUMBER_ *Concerns with this option*: performance improvement could be comparable to cheaper options, bad bang-for-buck, or in the "diminishing returns" territory for amount of money spent. ___________________________________________________________________ Does anyone have experience with any of the options? Did/do you with you just skipped to option _NUMBER_ ? Or do you regret jumping the gun and going to option _NUMBER_ and think you would have been happy with options _NUMBER_ or _NUMBER_ ? Any and all feedback is appreciated thanks!
So yesterday after not driving my volt for a few days I realized that my drivers side seat really isn't that comfortable. Does anyone have ideas or suggestions on how to make more comfortable. Seems to give me a bit of a lower back pain, now grant it, I do have a long commute so sitting for over an hour or two at times isnt great, but still.... I made the same drive for years in a different car previously but didnt get the same feeling.. Just curious if anyone else experience same or had an easy fix.. THX
Picking up my _NUMBER_ White WRX Limited on June 15th and I am looking recommendations as to what mods to add to it! I know that at the end of the day, I should be modding for what interests me, but I am open to suggestions from other owners. What do you or do you not like? What works and what doesn't? So far I have already purchased a Perrin Shifter Stop. I am looking at buying JDM DRL fog light bezels, as well as the corresponding harness to make the "C" lights DRLs as well. I am also looking at the JDM front grille. I think somewhere down the line I will crack open my headlights and paint them black as well. What other suggestions do you have?
Here is the car: _URL_ Sort of in the market for a newer car. Just trying to get a feeler. I like the sedan civic si. Most seems to have _NUMBER_ -80k and run about _NUMBER_ -12k in price. Not looking to be bashed on or start anything but just generally curious if this is remotely realistic when it comes to a price on one with low miles like this.
Car: _NUMBER_ Subaru WRX, 112k miles, stock except for new (slotted)rotors and pads, never tracked as long as I have owned it ( _NUMBER_ yrs, past 60k miles) I have been experiencing a vibration with a growling noise, felt in the steering wheel and floor, that does not change with braking, can be felt at 30mph+ going straight, and much lower when turning. Turning is associated with a popping noise. While driving at highway speeds, the front passenger wheel sounds like it's always on rough pavement, and every ~ _NUMBER_ seconds it feel a slight bump like I ran over something, but I didn't. On top of that, every ~ _NUMBER_ seconds the car will shake, as if the wheels aren't straight, mostly felt at _NUMBER_ mph. The tires should have at least 10k miles left, brakes and calipers are fine, alignment and balancing has been checked and done multiple times. Rear wheel bearings were changed about 10k miles ago. I'm more than a little concerned, given how often I take the car on the high way and with colder weather coming up. What should I be checking, and what is most likely to have broken down? All the research I have done thus far points to CV joints or wheel bearings, or maybe tie rods. Thanks r/Subaru in advance for the help *Edit* Update: now that I am mostly sure that I am dealing with CV Joint issues, does anyone have any tips on how to remove the pins that hold the axles on? Everywhere I've looked, people have just made makeshift tools :( *Update _NUMBER_ * changed ball bearing, reduced some of the vibrations and the shake. Inspected CVs, found no issue. Still feel some of the symptoms though. Am I just being paranoid, or should I keep looking?
Hey, My _NUMBER_ c350 coupe currently has staggered wheels and their sizes are; Front: _NUMBER_ /40R18 Rear: _NUMBER_ /35R18 I'm looking to get winter tires and rims but have no idea what other sizes I can put on my car. Can someone please help me out? I'm looking for the most cost effective option
I might receive the new MB A180D _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ whatever they call it. It has the bussiness pack by default and a bunch of other options added to it by my company. Now I see there's an option for a 'SmartPhone ConnectivityPack' which describes android auto and some feature from Apple. Which I don't care about, but this costs around _NUMBER_ Euro on top of the car, which I would have to my myself. Does this imply I only receive the ability to call/play music through Bluetooth if I purchase this option or is this something the car has by default? I don't know much about cars, sorry if this is a newbie question.
A couple of days ago as I got off the highway it refused to go past _NUMBER_ mph. Even now if i start to go past _NUMBER_ it sort of lurches forward and kind of slows down until i start going _NUMBER_ again. No error codes, and the transmission fluid is brown but close to full. Not sure what might be the issue(s)
My wife's phone is listed above mine under Phone Settings, which means the Volt automatically pairs to her phone and not mine when we're together. I did not see an option to change the order of the paired phones listed in the infotainment owner's manual , but I am assuming I can delete my phone's profile and then repair which will make my phone the top one on the list. Does that sound correct? Am I missing a setting somewhere to change the order of the phones?
_URL_ _URL_ _URL_ _URL_ _URL_ I bought this a couple of weeks ago. It was surprisingly sunny and warm out today, so I got a chance to wash it and take some pictures. I bought a house a little over a year ago, and I needed something to haul off a pile of "too large for the trash bin" junk in the back yard. My wife's sister also wants to visit the US for a year for school and will need something to drive, plus we need to get some furniture for her. I started off my search looking for stuff like old Ford Rangers , F-150s, Exploders etc., but wow do those things hold their value for anything that isn't a total wreck. I saw a Trailblazer for sale and remembered that the _NUMBER_ -7X was a thing. As usual, the price to nice ratio of a Saab couldn't be beat. It's a _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ -7X _NUMBER_ .2i. I found it at some buy here pay here dealer in Seattle. _NUMBER_ miles. Single previous owner. It needs a few things, but is in the best shape of any that I saw online (except for ones with crazy low miles and double the price). Whoever had it before seems to have cared for it, and it doesn't look like the back seats were used much (so no kids). It even came with the Weathertech floor mats. I can see why this didn't do well at the original asking price, but for what I got it for, it's fantastic. It's supposed to be an extra vehicle, but my _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ has been sitting in the garage since I picked it up. I love this thing. Things it needs: * ~~water pump~~ done * alignment * wheel balance * a couple of the radio/steering wheel buttons are starting to delaminate * replace radio with something that supports AUX and bluetooth * stupid air suspension B.S. Also, I happened to park next to this at work, and took some pictures for comparison. _URL_ _URL_
I have a _NUMBER_ GLT and recently the speedometer has only been working intermittently. When I start driving, it works fine, but somewhere along the way it drops to _NUMBER_ and stays there. If I turn the car off and on, it works again. If I'm not mistaken, the speedometer is powered by one of the ABS fuses, but both are still intact. My ABS module is dead, but it's been dead since before I got the car and the speedometer problems began two days ago. Anyone have any ideas?
A few month ago I was interested in buying a second MS or a MX. Now this week a sale agent tried to call me several times to ask if i'm still interested in buying a Tesla and that they would have some perfect fits ready to pick up in the store and some other nonsense. My assistant always picked up the phone but let's face it... They want to get rid off the old cars, right? If this is really the case though, I would be pissed off that they tried so hard to sell me a car when I would later find out that the refresh is just around the corner. Nevertheless, I'll wait for the refresh.
Hey so first off its all in parts, i have everything to make it complete. the goal of this bike is to have it look like a "club style" bobber. mainly id like to know what kind of speed parts are available for it in the way of cams, valves and springs, carbs, exhaust also id like to know where to find a solo seat that isnt crazy expensive, same with "T-bars" like lucky dave's handlebars. if i have to ill just make t-bars but fill me in on the iron head, im all ears
so as i said in the title, i am currently considering a _NUMBER_ series. The car has the sports package, manual trans,53k miles and is the _NUMBER_ model. The guy is asking 11k but i might be able to get it down to 10k. Does this seem like a worthy buy? does anyone know if these _NUMBER_ models are plagued with problems? would love to hear some feedback. Thank you in advance.
So, I'm moving to a new home in a few weeks and am looking into having an outlet or outlets installed in the garage. Ideally I'd like to have two outlets or chargers installed but just one is a possibility as well. Does anyone have advice or experience with this? What is the best type of outlet to install? I was thinking about the Tesla chargers but also wondering if maybe just a standard outlet would be better so it could be used by other types of EV's in the future. Does anyone know what is the difference between a _NUMBER_ amp and _NUMBER_ amp installation? Which is better, cheaper, etc? Anyone have experience doing this and have ideas as to total cost? Thanks in advance for your input.
I just got my odb2 code and it was p0638. I looked online and there's different fixes for it some are saying it's something to do with the gas pedal some are saying I have to replace the whole throttle body and some are saying to clean the h42- _NUMBER_ pins under the natter tray. Anyone have a definite answer to help me solve this problem?
Anyone have (or had) a Sundowner _NUMBER_ -up seat? Want to keep the wife comfortable, but I'm _NUMBER_ ' _NUMBER_ " and like the way I "fit" on the bike when I'm stopped (short guy problems). The SD seat seems very thick and somewhat high. Thanks in advance. I'm new to the H-D world and this sub has been great for answering my questions.
_NUMBER_ volvo _NUMBER_ . Went to get into my car today and he just died. No crank at all, only very faint ding from the key in the ignition, brake locked in place. Then, without the key in the ignition, there's a strange whirring noise coming from inside the car unless I turn the dome light on. (very faint but still works) It makes an even louder version of this sound with the charger put on the battery. Any idea what's going on? Forum search has come up empty and the shop is closed on my off days.
Hello, I'm trying to gather information on installing a tow hitch which I will use to tow my bikes around. Has anyone here installed one ? I installed one in my _NUMBER_ wrx and had to drill thru from inside the trunk space under the spare tire compartment is it the same for this car ?? U haul sells a hitch for _NUMBER_ and charges the total with install is like $ _NUMBER_ . If I can do it myself I save a ton of money! Thanks !
So, I've been searching around and there are loads of conflicting information on the forums . Some say it's possible to get it to play video from SD card, as long as it's in specific format. I've tried them all and still can't get my A4 (Premium) to play any videos. Some formats do play, but it only plays audio, no picture. My manual says it supports video formats up to _NUMBER_ ,000kbps bitrate, 720x576 resolution at maximum 25fps. I'm using Handbrake to convert/re-encode, I've tried exactly that format still no luck. Do I need a higher trim level or specific package to get the video playback? In my manual, anything related to video playback is marked with an asterisk, indicating it's only available in a certain trim/package, but no mention which one. I only have convenience package installed. I know there are ways to reprogram/hack/enable video in motion, but I just want to see if there's a legit way to do it first, I just want to play video while stationary.
Hey guys! So following my post about the print warping issue, today I bought glass, cut it (wasn't as hard as I was expecting, although the corners are ugly!), and printed and installed a 2mm spacer since I measured my glass @ 2mm. I then cleaned the glass with rubbing alcohol, then put down some glue stick, and re-printed my problem part from the warping post _NUMBER_ days ago. Surpise! No warping! My problem now is I CANNOT get the print off! I've tried safety razor blades, spatulas, even tried spritzing some rubbing alcohol around the edges to loosen the print. I've already marred the print trying to get it off, and I'm worried I'm going to chip the glass if I put any more force. Is there any magic trick? =)
Video: _URL_ Has anyone seen a Sonata beep or whistle like this? It only happens when I accelerate from stopped. The AC is on. It happens when it's off too. Tried toggling the air recycle, no difference. You can hear it outside. It's just a coincidence that it stopped when the blinker went off. It happens when I'm not signaling.
I recently got in an accident which totaled the ' _NUMBER_ Lexus IS350 I was driving at the time. Originally I wanted to get another Lexus since I plan to keep my cars for a long time, but then I remembered I live in Dallas and people here are terrible drivers and the chances of my car surviving multiple years is not high. Also the dealerships in my areas don't have many IS350's available since most people who drive Lexus don't care about performance and would rather settle for the IS200t. I hopped on over to the BMW dealership to test drive some cars, drove the M240 and the _NUMBER_ . I loved how the M240 drove, it was such a fun car to drive, I couldn't believe how much better it drove than my Lexus. Sadly, the M240 is probably way above my budget and I was thinking about buying a used car this time rather than New so I don't get burned when a car gets totaled. The dealership had some CPO cars available on their lot, they actually had a ' _NUMBER_ M235 which I wanted to check out, sadly they literally sold the car just minutes before I got to the used department. The sales guy told me about a metallic grey ' _NUMBER_ with 25k miles they had so I test drove it. It's a tad bit slower than the M240 but still a whole lot of fun. I was shocked that the interior doesn't look outdated at all, everything looks modern and to be in good condition. At the end of the day driving the _NUMBER_ put a smile on my face and I wanted it. I do have a bunch of questions since I want to make an informed decision rather than an emotional buy. * I read on some forums that low mileage oil change is highly recommended. Looking at the BMW report they printed out for me it looks like the only time the oil has been changed was when it hit 18k miles after two years of ownership. Is this a huge issue and red flag? Is it possible that there was an oil change but it just wasn't documented? * What are some common things to look for on a used _NUMBER_ that I should take note of and try to check it out? * The original warranty on this car expires on _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ , and the CPO expires on _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ . Is it worth it to buy extended coverage? The sales guy told me the extended coverage can cover brake pads, however all the stuff I read online said that CPO and extended warranties are very limited in what they cover, and brake pads aren't one of them. Also do I have to purchase extended warranty before the original warranty ends or when the CPO warranty ends? My final question is whether or not the price is a good price or not? The dealer originally had it at 36k but then lowered it to 33k today, and then I negotiated it a bit more to 32k which is exactly 35k OTD. Here's the listed options and basic spec of this car: * This is a lease return. It was returned at the end of September which means this car has been on the lot for a bit more than a month now. * Exterior color: Mineral Grey Metallic * Interior: Leather Black/Red highlight/Stitching * Odometer 25k * RWD * Sport Line * Premium Package * Technology Package * CO2 relevant vehicles * Sport Automatic Transmission * Tire Pressure monitor * Alarm System * Universal Garage-door opener * Moonroof * Without Lines designation * Moonroof * Floor mats * Auto dimming mirrors * Auto-dimming rearview mirror * Power front seats * Split fold down rear seat * Storage package * Heated front seats * Anthracite Wood Trim * Highlight trim finishers pearl * Blow-by heater * Park distance control * Rain sensor and auto headlights * Xenon headlights * Adaptive light control * Automatic climate control * Ambient lighting * Additional _NUMBER_ -V power sockets * Harman Kardon surround sound * DVD area coding NA * BMW TeleServices * Teleservice control * CIC contribution * M Sport Suspension * Increased top speed limiter * Variable light decoding * TeleService Activation * Oil Chg 15k miles/ _NUMBER_ month * Daytime driving lights
Whenever I try to heat up my extruder, either in preheat mode or at the start of a print, the temperature reading will consistently freeze at five or ten degrees below the target temperature. I've replaced the thermistor and upgraded to the latest firmware, yet it still always freezes ten degrees below the target. Once it freezes, the number wont change until I reset the printer, and it will continue getting hotter and hotter without the display changing. Does anyone know a fix to this, or any way to stop this from happening?
Recently bought a _NUMBER_ Sonata from a dealer who offered a great deal closing them out for the _NUMBER_ models (and I prefer the front grille design of the _NUMBER_ anyway). Loving the car, but one thing and one thing alone is a major thorn in my side right now: Bluetooth calling is nigh-unusable, nobody can hear me. I mostly have attempted to make calls using the Android Auto interface, as my phone is a midrange android device (Moto phone). The other callers report that I come through in audible but choppy spurts, almost as if the microphone is muting or only picking up bits and pieces as opposed to picking up too quietly or not at all. The rest of Android Auto and the head unit functions perfectly. I don't really have access to another Android device to test with apart from my phone right now. Anyone have any suggestions on the end of the car or my phone? It's running Android Nougat, if that matters. I think my Android Auto is up to date as well, but I am less sure of that.
I know that title may seem weird but I have this crazy idea that I want to put 37s on my two inch spacer lifted _NUMBER_ TJ sport _NUMBER_ cyl automatic. I already have the tube fenders for front and back taken care of. What I'm more worried about is the gearing, braking, SYE, and other mechanical parts and suspension parts that I'm going to have to upgrade. If anyone could give me some insight into the parts I'm going to have to look for that would be great. I know this isn't a cheap plan and ideally I'd love to get the brakes upgraded and it regeared and 37s on it and then I can slowly add more parts to it. This is all so I can creat a LCOG rig for out in the sand dunes and probably very minor rock crawling if any. Also it'll see a lot of pavement too since I drive it around all the time. And comments or suggestions would be awesome. Thanks!
I have been searching for sites that carry aftermarket parts for the _NUMBER_ and haven't had much luck. Every site I seem to find only carries more recent years, generally _NUMBER_ to _NUMBER_ '. I haven't really looked into aftermarket parts for a vehicle since _NUMBER_ so no idea what sites are good these days, plus I have never owned a Mazda before now. Links please?
So...bit of the backstory: for about a month I'd been having issues with the car; rough idle, both rpm and turbo surging, and weak acceleration. Did a bit of reading, and found it was consistent with a dirty throttle, but ended up taking it back to the local mechanic, who couldn't replicate the issues but replaced the coil ignition because there was an error code coming off. Fast forward a bit, and I decided to take off the throttle body for a good cleaning/looking at discovered the PCV valve was broken . Ordered a new one, plus some other parts/pieces I discovered were broken or old, but now hit a slight snag. The broken end of the valve is still in the old hose, and I don;t know if it's possible to get it out. If it can't be removed, does anyone know the part number for the hose here? (image is from before I took the throttle body off) ...and is it a simple fix? Never really worked on a car before, and the last thing I want is to mess something up.
Title says it all. My CLS lease is ending soon. I drove an E300 this past week and was impressed. The _NUMBER_ -cyl is better than I expected. Its nothing like my current 402hp _NUMBER_ -cyl, but its good for daily driving. I want to move into something a bit more posh. Here is my build. Its basically loaded up all the way. Imgur Any opinions on the designo Selenite Grey Magno color? I have heard mixed opinions, some raving that it looks amazing and is easy to care for, and others dismissing it as ugly and difficult to care for. Any ideas?
Just in case anybody was thinking about it... They weren't horribly transparent on this besides "we expect to get it working before your Powerwall installation". Welp, got installed. Works only as backup power as far as I know. Not too big a deal, but for those thinking about it, you should know.
Hi, I have a _NUMBER_ 745Li and while approaching a red light I accidentally pushed the Parking Brake button. I was probably going _NUMBER_ -4mph at the time. The car kind of jolted for half a second and then continued rolling, and the parking brake light did not come on. Once stopped I activated the brake again and that time the light came on and then I was able to deactivate it. Could someone explain what happened there? Did the car automatically disengage the brake? Did I mess anything up? I feel like a complete idiot but it was an honest accident.
Well, while I was cleaning my car, I turned on the dome light using the switch and the switch broke off with no effort at all. I'm referring to the stage switch which goes from Off-Door Open-On. Unfortunate. The dealership wants $ _NUMBER_ to fix it. Does anyone have any experience in replacing that switch, and know where I can find a replacement part? My google searches are only finding replacements for the entire unit or the bulbs.
Hello /r/harley! I recently had a K&N performance air intake and a Power Commander V put on my ' _NUMBER_ Dyna Superglide Custom. I am looking to slowly but surely keep adding pieces and components to give it that extra pep in its step. (before I get too far, there is a dyno scheduled for this weekend) Anyways, what suggestions can you all offer to continue to improve performance? EDIT: Forgot to mention I already replaced and have Scream Eagle II pipes on there.
First off, I have never done a wheelie on anything in my life. I have an _NUMBER_ xl1200r, and I have been itching to try it. I understand the concept of dumping the clutch, but what gear/speed/Rpms do I need to be shooting for? My main concern is the stability when that front wheel comes up and when it slams back down. Any advice would be appreciated! Note, I just want to do it one time not make it a regular thing. Edit: I guess I will just buy a dirt bike _EMOJI_
I picked up a replacement block and one head from a ' _NUMBER_ Outback to put in my ' _NUMBER_ forester. I plan on using one head from my forester. The block seems like it's in good condition and has far less miles on it than mine. The only thing that worries me is that the pistons have a different imprint on them and they also protrude out of the head about a mm whereas the pistons in my original block do not. Will this affect the compression where it will be a problem? Is there an easy way to check the condition of the rods and bearings while I have it out?
I stepped on the brake pedal with all of my rotors on except one (don't ask me why please). Now that caliper is compressed and I can't slide it back on the rotor. How do I open the caliper back up? Do I just loosen the bleed valve on that one caliper and push them open?
Had a note through my front door last night from an anonymous neighbor who told me that he had shut the trunk on my Model S because it was open. Very worrying as the car was definitely locked (I have lock on walk away enabled, both keys are accounted for). Just called Technical Support and they will try and pull the logs on Monday. Eek!
Regarding the stock clutch on my _NUMBER_ GT IDK if it's just a break in period thing or what but when I shift _NUMBER_ -> _NUMBER_ and _NUMBER_ -> _NUMBER_ it just seems clunky and even sounds clunky at times. The engagement point seems awkward also. The clutch on my _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ feels so much better it drives me crazy that my _NUMBER_ GTs clutch is inferior in every way to my _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ . does t just take time to get used to? I know how to drive manual, I genuinely feel like this isn't user error, but shifting in lower gears with this _NUMBER_ stock clutch feels so clunky. I will be installing the steeda assist spring on Wednesday and am really hoping it makes a big difference. Anyone else have a similar experience?
Hey everyone, I moved to the Pacific Northwest from Montana and this will be my first winter with rain instead of constant snow. I was wondering if/how people in rainy climates keep the inside from building up condensation. Since I lived in Montana it stayed cold enough to where it wasnt an issue but in the PNW (coupled with multiple things going out causing the TJ to stay unmoved for several months) I have noticed that there is moisture on the inside on the top and windows as well as causing mold and getting the seats wet. I wasnt sure if this is just part of having a soft top in a rainy climate or if it is specific to the Rampage Frameless top as well.
I have done a bit of research on the topic but cant seem to find a definitive answer. I'd like to track rex every so often and would like to upgrade my suspension. I daily drive my car and drive an average of 3k miles every _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ months (Mostly highway) Otherwise I drive pretty conservatively. The Car is only cobb "stage _NUMBER_ " with a turboback and accessport tune. So I dont need $ _NUMBER_ suspension as I wont be going fast enough. I would like to do some track driving before I give in to real power mods. Can someone please reccomend springs, struts and a swaybar, or coilovers etc. and tell me how those mods have effected their ride quality. Thanks for the help.
Would it be easier just to use a roll cage for this purpose or would it be better and cheaper to build something specifically for this purpose? How could I go about looking for info on this? Good search terms etc? My vehicle is a _NUMBER_ Chevy Blazer with a stock fiberglass shell in the back.
So i'm at odds with tail lights. When I got the bike the tail light was melted so i got a drag specialties and put it on and immediately took it off because i couldn't see it in my driveway. Then i put on a custom dynamics and was a little happier but seeing other guys running them they don't seem that bright during the day and that makes me nervous. Maybe the probeam is brighter, but i haven't seen one in the wild. I wish the people that made those stupid bright ambulance tail lights would make one for my bike. link _URL_
Hi all, I'm in the market for a new vehicle and mustang seems like one of my favorite options but i'm having a hard time honing in on what i want. I was hoping y'all could share some of your thoughts. Some background i can afford ~30k but reallly don't want to spend that much. **used vs new** have yall had issues buying a used mustang? **gt vs v6** gt sounds amazing, but is 8k more. I feel the gt is something special but is it worth in your opinion? Do you feel the gt gives that much more power than v6? **premium vs not** prem i might be able to manage if i buy a used. im just not thinking its worth the extra cost. if i did go prem id want a unique interior, and probably the surround system since premium is.. a premium cost. but that bloats price far too high. I'm leaning towards base gt simply to keep cost down and dont feel its worth it. **Manual vs Standard** This will be a daily driver and I live in a big congested town (houston). Also many close family members suggest automatic, and at least it has paddles. With that said i feel like to have that much power and not be connected to it seems weird. Can you peel out (not burn out) in an automatic? I drive a manual truck and the clutch is hella heavy. in bad traffic it gets annoying, tho i try to avoid traffic. **Are stripes cheezy?** I really like the idea of offcentered stripe, esp on a white (white platinum) car. Is there some stigma against it. **Convertable?** Anyone think this is absolutely worth it? I think i might rent a v6 convertable manual just to see how it feels. Also talking this out really helps me gauge how i feel. Id appreciate any feedback!
Hey All! So I've noticed when I print larger things, my PLA will start to warp away from the bed especially so when it's a thicker part of the build internally. Here is an example from a Raspberry Pi case I printed today: _URL_ Is this because I have the bed warmer running? I printed this with the bed set @ _NUMBER_ , and was using glue stick to hold everything down. Filament was Hatchbox PLA which I'm running @ _NUMBER_ . Thanks! EDIT Forgot to mention, it prints flat to begin with, but starts curling up around an inch of height into the print.
So im considering to buy a used Porsche Panamera model year _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ as my budget is just about _NUMBER_ Euro. The thing is, I dont really know which model to buy. I really want to get the GTS because most of them have the beautiful sports steering wheel (as I hate the regular one), nice seats with Alcantara, nice exhaust and they are lower. The problem is I dont need all that extra horsepower and speed so it would be kind of a waste to own the GTS, especially when the other models are much much cheaper. Some of them even feature the nice steering wheel but its a hit or miss. I just cant get myself to pay 15k more just for a prettier steering wheel and seets. What model would you get if you were in my situation and is it possible to change the steering wheel later on?
I'm considering buying a _NUMBER_ A4 w/t Quattro ( _NUMBER_ -speed gearbox, so as I understand it, it doesn't have the "ultra" Quattro). I was curious if this car has any sort of front or rear LSD or are those differentials open? I don't think the A4 is offered with the "sport differential."
Whenever I am in engine mode and release the accelerator I hear a high pitched whine that is very annoying and distracting to me. My mom can't hear it but I do and I hate it. Does anyone else have this problem? If so what can I do to remedy this situation ?
Hey together, a week ago I've received my new Malyan M200 and tried to print at first the calibration cube to see how it looks. Yesterday I got the first good print from it and I noticed that the first two layers were a bit... hilly... When the printer laid down the infill on the first layer there were bumps and zits in it and they pushed the nozzle up when it moves back over them and wanted to print the 2nd layer. Material was the stock PLA, which comes with the printer. Does anybody noticed something similar? My second question is, did anybody tray to isolate the heatbed from beneath? With something like cork or similar materials? Edit _NUMBER_ : I'm using a FR4 plate to print on.
Currently driving an _NUMBER_ Accord LX with 324K on the dial. Only needed to change an axle, O2 sensor, and a ball joint. This car is bulletproof, and has me wanting the eventual replacement to be another Honda. I was saddened to see that CR gave a poor rating to the current gen Civic EX-T in expected reliability. I had my heart set on this car. Can anyone enlighten me to why this is? I also hear/see a lot of chatter on the internet in various places that Honda "had gone downhill" or "don't make them like they used to". Don't see the same about Toyota. Please explain so that I don't buy a Corolla, I beg of you.
Just bought a _NUMBER_ M3 GT hatchback, and noticed that there wasn't a tie down hook with the spare tire. Salesman said it can be purchased as an accessory, but I'm thinking it should be included with the vehicle as standard. The manual has a section on its use, and makes no mention of it not being included. Can anyone verify for me if it should be there and its missing, or if it really is something you'd have to buy separately from the vehicle?
I want to jump into my first Audi and I'm having trouble deciding on two that are in my budget. _NUMBER_ A4 Premium with _NUMBER_ miles (white) _NUMBER_ A4 Premium with _NUMBER_ miles (black) Both have the same features but priced $ _NUMBER_ different. I'm having trouble deciding on the two for the following reasons; _NUMBER_ . I really like the white color _NUMBER_ . $ _NUMBER_ savings _NUMBER_ . The white has wood interior, which I like. _NUMBER_ . Black has the lower milage. _NUMBER_ . Black has longer life span? _NUMBER_ . Salesman said Black will have better warranty? (I'm a little iffy about that statement). _NUMBER_ . Both were leases with the white having two owners, and the black having one. Can I get some advice or some foresight on these that I am missing? I think the warranty on both will run out at the same time, correct? So even if I get the lower milage one, the warranty will still end next year in _NUMBER_ ... Thank you for your time.
I have been lurking on this sub since I had my ' _NUMBER_ Viggen a few years back. Since then I have owned a ' _NUMBER_ Civic (totaled while parked) and a ' _NUMBER_ Suzuki Swift (going in garage for overall rebuild mods). I loved the Viggen but it was fraught with rust and wasn't well taken care of. I had to have one of the rear wheel wheels cut out and a new section welded in. I moved down to VA a month ago. The week before leaving my Swift's transmission exploded. The case broke at the shifter linkage. I sourced a junkyard one, put it in, and it was lacking 5th...but I made it to VA with _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ . I plan on making longer trips and needed a safer-than-tin-can car. After a fairly thorough craigslist hunt for a replacement I found a dealer with an ' _NUMBER_ Aero w/130k miles, one owner, dealer maintained. I bought it after a little waggling for what I felt was a fair price. I would give the exterior a _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ ; the paint is shiny but has had its fair share of whacks. The interior is a near perfect _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ though, very clean. Mechanically it could use some maintenance but I am well versed in what needs to be done. I plan on adding an oem front lip, rear spoiler, and roof rack to complete the aesthetics. Other than that I just plan on driving it until it doesn't make sense to anymore. I just spent a ton of hours detailing it. Wash, clay bar, wax, trim, interior, engine...it was a nice weekend for it! PICS
Hey folks, I'm replacing the allen head bolts that are being used as exhaust studs on my bike with... actual exhaust studs. They all came out fine except one it was turning just fine, but then the bolt broke off. It's got about _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ " sticking out (plenty to put a nut on) and maybe about that much still inside. The obvious answer is "have a nut welded on it and turn it out the rest of the way" but the nearest chopper shop straight up refused to do it ("won't work, it'll get too brittle and break again, never seen one work"), welding places are quoting me insane prices ($ _NUMBER_ just to weld a nut on), other more distant mechanics are saying it'll be a while before they get around to it. Is it possible that if I screwed a nut on with red loctite it would hold enough to turn it out, or am I crazy. It was taking some oomph to turn, but not THAT much oomph, before it snapped. I can't quite get two nuts on it or I'd do that. Any other options before I bite the bullet and have one of these insane welders do it? Thanks!
has anyone replaced the stock tweeter with something aftermarket? what can and won't fit in the stock location? im hoping that my installer can somehow make the illusion audio c3cx fit in the stock corner dash location (crutchfield website says it doesn't fit). he's sorta far from me so if i can avoid having to drive there for him to personally look at it that'd be ideal. i've found diagrams for the _NUMBER_ and in japanese but looking for speaker diameters, mounting depth required, that sorta thing. thanks!
So, I have a stanced ' _NUMBER_ VW GLI that I'll be keeping but I plan to buy a nicer daily driver that I'll have less need to mod out of the box. I want something practical but doesn't sacrifice too much fun. I've done some research and have narrowed it down to an ' _NUMBER_ X1 (xdrive35i), ' _NUMBER_ 535i wagon and ' _NUMBER_ 328i wagon. Now, the X1 is the most expensive of the bunch but will be the newest and has the more reliable N55 as. The 535i has the N54 so I'm a bit weary but the size and interior are kind of perfect (my dad used to have an ' _NUMBER_ 750i so it reminds me of it a lot). And lastly the 328i wagon with the N52 which is definitely less of a riot and more 'ol reliable. Am I missing some key options here? Cargo space is important that is why it is a wagon or SUV sorta thing I'm looking for. But, the X1 was kinda small if I remember correctly from being in it years ago. I'm also _NUMBER_ ' _NUMBER_ " _NUMBER_ lbs (muscular) and like to go skiing and carry gym equipment regularly. The space is a must or I'm just kind of wasting money.
Hey all! So I recently acquired a new truck shell with one of those sweet doors that replaces the tailgate with a smaller hatch-style door embedded into THAT door. Kinda like... doorception? Anyways, the original door was trashed and didn't come with the original hinges. The previous owner just drilled and slapped what look to be literal interior door hinges, but the original inset for the factory hinges remain. That being said, I cannot for the life of me find the right hinges. Any ideas? Here's the inset: _URL_ Apologies for the horrifying reflection and yeti-like arm, cheers!
I've had lots of extrusion issues and fairly spongy prints lately. Lots of little extrusion knock back errors causing a little less filament than what is needed for a solid smooth surface. A while back, I had a bad print that caused the kapton tape and insulation to rip off the print head. Could poor insulation be what is causing this issue? I've never seen another Hot End that had insolation like that, so I don't really know. If that is causing the issue, how do I fix it? I have some kapton, but where do I get high temp insulation like that?
I have a _NUMBER_ Passat Variant _NUMBER_ FSI with an RCD300 and I was thinking of getting an aftermarket head unit with bluetooth and a touchscreen. Possibly Android Car. And I would prefer it to just be plug and play. Now, I'm not very knowledgeable about any of this so I've been trying to find as much information as I can online and one thing I've come across is that since it's an _NUMBER_ I might have to replace the can-bus gateway to avoid having my battery drained. Does this apply to aftermarket units as well or is it just the _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ original units specifically? I've seen that there are hacked firmwares for these original units which makes me wonder if it's just them or if there's some protocol that changed which would affect all newer units. Thanks for taking the time and please ELI5 if you go more in depth about something :D
Loving the car so far! I drive _NUMBER_ miles a day (round trip) _NUMBER_ % highway and I keep up with traffic ( _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ mph). If my gauge is accurate it's telling me I'm getting _NUMBER_ MPG average. I am quite impressed! I've effectively trippled my gas milage coming from an _NUMBER_ Honda Element.
Hey all. I got myself a _NUMBER_ Volt LT and while I'm loving it, little things annoy me like the wipers leaving a huge untouched spot in the middle of the windshield, no light in the glove box, middle seat in the back not realistic and no rear vents, it is a great car. I do Have a question though. For the first time, tonight I peaked my head outside to take a quick peak at it charging and the fan was going. It's 9pm here and only _NUMBER_ degrees Celsius. Does the charging get too hot that it needs to be cooled down ?
Hey guys so I know there's been posts like this on here before but I'm gonna shoot this out there again. I found a _NUMBER_ 325xi accident-free with over _NUMBER_ ,000km on it as I'm looking for a first car and there's just something about the look of the older style _NUMBER_ series that I love. From experience or what any of you have heard how reliable are these cars? From what I've read I'm gonna make sure to get the car looked over by a trusted mechanic before purchasing anything and I heard somewhere to stay away from automatic transmission? This one is an automatic as well. Thanks guys.
So at least one of my problems with prints was the arm on the feeder had snapped. Wasn't enough to be obvious be enough that there was no pressure on the filament to feed. When I was switching out the feeder with the metal one from Amazon I seem to have stripped the set screw. pic Has anyone had any luck getting them out??
The web says it's _NUMBER_ HP, but the power indicator on the dash maxes out at _NUMBER_ kW = _NUMBER_ HP. Is it because _NUMBER_ is the power of the gas engine by itself, but the electric motor(s) can add another _NUMBER_ HP to that? Also, that max power seems to be an artificial limitation imposed by the engine controls, since the max is exactly the same (a nice round number) regardless of whether in electric or hybrid mode. Does anyone know the full story here?
Looked at this _NUMBER_ ' V6 2WD with 107k on her. Clean, _NUMBER_ owner southern vehicle that checked out free of issues from my mechanic. Lowest I could get the dealer was $ _NUMBER_ .7k before taxes, title, etc. I offered $ _NUMBER_ .2k cash but they didn't bite so I walked out. My whole rub was I could get a 4WD for $16k. What do ya think? Do I have unrealistic expectations given the current market? Anyone buy a 4th gen recently in the same ballpark? UPDATE: Sure enough, the dealer counter-offered a couple days after I walked out. Ended up settling on $ _NUMBER_ for the vehicle. She's a beauty . Thanks for your help guys!
I just got my Jeep in December. Flying rocks are killing me. Last month a rock chipped paint off the front of my hood. Today a rock somehow hit my driver door and chipped paint also. I just looked at the hood area and there's rust already and will soon be happening to the door. Is there anything that can be done after paint is chipped off to prevent the rusting?
Currently have a B7 A4 with the manual trans, and 80k on the clock. Did the carbon cleaning so far have an upgraded HP fuel pump, cat back, newest version of the turbo bypass valve, coil packs, lower temp spark plugs, drilled slotted rotors b/c they look cool, and a PCV catch can and high flow cat both on order. (Already have done timing belt, clutch, chain doesn't rattle, new motor mounts, changed all the diff fluids, oil changing every 5k ect. all basic maintenance items) So when I get those things installed, I'll be ready for an ECM reflash. I've narrowed it down to either APR or Unitronics as a tuner, mostly because they are the two closest dealers to me. Cost wise they fall close enough together that I'm not really too concerned about that side of things, so I'm mostly looking for opinions from people that have run either one. From what I can tell APR is a very drive able tune, and generally gets praise as being reliable if not a little conservative. Their website doesn't offer too much info on anything beyond the stage _NUMBER_ tune. (If anyone has these numbers that'd be helpful) Unitronics on the other hand with their Stage _NUMBER_ HPFP tune has a claimed 275hp/310tq, on the components I've got/am getting. The question I have is the reliability of it. Since this car is getting the role as daily, I'd rather not throw one of the rods out the side of the block with an over aggressive tune... but it also looks fun as hell. So what to you all think? Is one genuinely better than the other? Will either one give me trouble on cold New England winters? Has anyone delt with any of these companies before? Thank you!
Im not talking about mud bogging or anything there. This weeked while out hunting it rained and the roads get wet enough to make a mess of my pickup. One side of the truck is covered in dirt while the other is practically clean. What could cause this? Is something not aligned? _NUMBER_ Toyota Tundra, stock wheels and I am only running some P245/70R16 tires. The factory fender flares are pretty danged wide so I cant figure out why one side is dirty and the other isnt.
Also I could use some input on recommended tires, brakes and brake fluid for occasional track days. I would guess probably _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ days a year. I'd like to safely learn how to push the limits of the car on a track. After just a short time with my recent purchase I've learned to respect just how hard you can take one of these to the edge. I think excellent sight lines are a very underrated quality in a fast car and I love the fact that I know where the wheels are in this car at all times. I bought it to drive and want to know what I'm doing from a technical standpoint.
All Has anyone mapped acceleration performance to battery charge level? I'm trying to get a handle on how much of a performance impact to expect as battery charge declines. I realize this will vary by model and battery size selfishly I'm primarily interested in the data for a Model S P90DL, however even an analysis on an older model would be helpful to see. I wasn't able to locate anything here on Reddit, and the only one I found over at TMC is from _NUMBER_ . Tx in advance
Hi all! So, I've been fiddling with my MPSM for about a week now, testing out different D&D mini models out there(Full credit to /U/mz4250 for the designs). I'm getting really good detail, but on the smaller, more detailed parts, I'm getting stray strands as the printer moves between parts. I've been messing with retraction and temp settings to see if I could get past it, and it did improve, but I'm still getting a few, see here . Also my settings are here and here . Any suggestions?
I've recently started looking at buying a _NUMBER_ boxster/cayman and was wondering what are your thoughts on the Porsche certified pre-owned program? For example, I'm looking at a used _NUMBER_ boxster s with lots of upgrades (sports chrono, bose, bi-xenon, etc) and 25k miles at $48k. On the other hand, theres a certified _NUMBER_ boxster s at 20k miles for $54k, but doesn't have as many upgrades. Its about $6k more for a certified porsche (and less options). Is it worth the extra $6k for a certified porsche? Both are being sold by porsche dealerships and I live in northern california if it helps.
Hi all, A branch fell on my _NUMBER_ IS350F yesterday while I had it out of the garage for a couple hours (can't believe my luck!) and hit my A-pillar. The dent itself seems pretty minor, but on the underside it cracked the paint (don't know how this happens, but sure?). The branch also hit the chrome trim underneath the window and caused a dimple there as well. I'm mostly concerned with the paint chipping, the actual dent is hardly noticeable. If it could be repaired using some kind of a pressure device at a body shop though I wouldn't be opposed to that for a couple hundred dollars either. Has anyone dealt with this kind of thing before and have any advice? I was just going to take it to a body shop, but I want to do what's best for my car ultimately. Pictures: _URL_
Hey all, I have the stock BMW 18inch run flats on my BMW 435i and it was recently introduced the shop where my dealer recommended new tires and quoted me $ _NUMBER_ . I'm not sure the brand but I'll probably get tires elsewhere and switch to non run flats due to comfort reasons. Does any have any recommendations on alternatives? Mostly highway and road travel in Texas.
Hey guys, My _NUMBER_ Civic (116K) is throwing two codes: P1457 EVAP System Leak Detected (Canister Area) P0133 HO2S- _NUMBER_ (Bank _NUMBER_ Sensor _NUMBER_ ) Circuit Slow Response Now I've done my own research and have found that having issues with filling up my gas tank (shutting itself off on its own) is related to the charcoal canister area. Any ideas on how I should attack this? I've done practically all maintenance on this vehicle and am pretty handy, but I am looking for suggestions and advice and figured I'd be able to turn here. I appreciate any help provided!
Hi, I recently bought a _NUMBER_ ES300 with about _NUMBER_ miles. Car is in great shape. Topped up all the fluids, but I can't seem to get a consistent reading on the transmission dipstick. I followed the service manual instructions: Park the vehicle on a level surface. With the engine idling and the parking brake applied, shift the selector into all positions from P to L and then shift into P position. Pull out the dipstick and wipe off the fluid with a clean rag. Re-insert the dipstick and check that the fluid level is in the HOT range. Do this check with the fluid at normal driving temperature ( _NUMBER_ ± _NUMBER_ °C, _NUMBER_ ± _NUMBER_ °F). The thing is, most of the time the dipstick appears almost completely dry. I've got it to a point where sometimes it shows in the cold range, sometimes not. After I add fluid, it's difficult to tell the proper level because the fluid is added to the same tube the dipstick rests in. I've added about _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ Qt of T IV ATF and I'm worried about overfilling as much as underfilling. Anybody with experience in this? Thanks!
I cannot for the life of me find a decent parts site to point me in the right direction. Somehow, the little plastic "catch" to hold my center console arm rest down snapped off. It is the catch for the larger part, not just the "arm rest lid" so to speak. Any pointers? Or do I need a whole new center console? :( Ugh, never mind, found wholesalehyundaiparts.com
Hoping someone can help me out! Just joined the Mazda3 family with a _NUMBER_ Mazda _NUMBER_ . It's running V55 firmware (can't remember the exact version I believe it ends in _NUMBER_ ). It was dealer certified pre-owned vehicle and I thought it came with navigation. But it seems it's another ploy to get me to pay $ _NUMBER_ for a nav simcard. I want to run the Android auto tweak, do I need the nav simcard for it to work? Thanks everyone!!
I've recently swapped out my stock mini apes for LuckyDaves SanDiego Bars, and in the process I found a female harness plug in the neck of the bike that had nothing plugged into it. Does anybody know what this is? I wish I could take pictures to show what I'm talking about but I'm currently _NUMBER_ miles away from my bike..
This happened a few days ago and i finally managed to do a post mortem. I was printing PLA with heatbed off. It got through about _NUMBER_ % of the print and stopped. Machine would not power on with the PSU. I tested it and it was completely burned out. Upon closer inspection my thermistor and heat block wires had fused together. I took the machine apart and the temperature sensor wires were the ones that blew. The white plastic was bubbled all the way up the tower and actually melted apart (The side if that matters) inside the machine. I replaced the whole thing (Temperature sensor and wires) and rewired it to use the slave heat bed power supply and it's now back up and running but I figured I'd give a heads up that it happened and see if maybe someone had an idea as to what could have happened. It's plugged into a protected power strip so surge seems unlikely but I guess it's possible.
Hey guys I bought a _NUMBER_ fatboy low a few months ago completely stock. I'm looking to do the stage _NUMBER_ mod intake/cleaner/exhaust and would like to get V&H big radius _NUMBER_ . I'm not sure about pairing the parts for best performance/compatibility. Any advice or resources? Not sure if there is a performance calculator or something. Thanks!
I have had my _NUMBER_ for about _NUMBER_ days now, and I had only driven it on my commute, about _NUMBER_ miles each day. This weekend I took it on the first road trip, from the Bay Area to Yosemite. The car was fantastic, supercharging was a simple and painless experience, and I love the car even more after the trip. The highlights: * Autopilot works well even on winding roads. When you are on a two-way road with speed limits that reduce when approaching a town, autopilot will automatically reduce your maximum speed to _NUMBER_ mph over the limit. This increases safety, and reduces driver fatigue. * Plenty of supercharger stalls at both Manteca and Groveland, you just plug it in and Tesla figures out authentication and payment. I am coming from the M-B B250e, which I simply couldn't take on this long a trip. When public charging on that car, I had to figure out how to pay, which was hit and miss. * This car really flies. When you are stuck on a one-lane road behind a minivan doing _NUMBER_ in a _NUMBER_ zone and there's a short straight stretch where passing is legal, you want to do that quickly. The first time I hit the accelerator hard, and in perhaps _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ seconds I was doing _NUMBER_ mph! * The lack of engine noise in a _NUMBER_ hour drive really makes a difference to how tired you feel at the end. The ride is really smooth and comfortable on freeways and back roads. * The frunk really helps. I thought this was mostly a gimmick, but it helped get all of our stuff in comfortably. It would be even better if: * We could control music from an iPod / phone on the huge display. Tesla should either provide that functionality over bluetooth or enable Android Auto / CarPlay in a portion of the screen. * Autopilot gave some indication that it's still going to do its thing when I signal a lane change. It sometimes just keeps blinking and does nothing. A beep of some sort indicating failure would be nice so I can take over and make the lane change myself. I finally have no reason to hold on to an ICE car. I can do long road trips with this car, so I will be ICE-free soon.
Hey, I just got my MP Select Mini (V2) about a week ago and everything was going smoothly... until now. While doing a print starting from the home axis, my nozzle touches down twice on the bed and does one of three things: a.) attempts to move off the exposed metal part of the platform, only to get stuck on the edge of the BuildTak, b.) repeatedly rams itself onto the bed, or c.) moves to the home axis but pushes down so hard it is immovable or gets caught in the screw's hole. I attempted to recalibrate using the provided hex tool on the corners of the print bed but the issue remains. I thought it was my own faulty gcode at first but even cat.gcode doesn't work. Here's a list of things I've done in an attempt to rectify the issue: * Turn the printer off/on * Unplug the printer * Try multiple different prints * Attempt printing from USB, WiFi, and microSD * Clean nozzle of all filament * Return printer to factory settings using WiFi gcode * Ensure that all mechanic components are in proper place (without messing with them lol) I'm at a loss right now, haha. Between getting the printer and this issue appearing, I haven't done much with it other than print a few small things and refill the filament with some nice HatchBox stuff. This issue could totally be a noob mistake, but I've skimmed the sidebar's document and I've read most pages on the wiki at this point. The one thing I haven't done is update it, because of this post . I plan on getting a borosilicate glass bed soon could that help? And when I do get a glass bed, should I remove the BuildTak before using it? Can I heat the bed even with the borosilicate glass? Sorry this is so long!
So today I was driving to my girlfriends house when my car seemed like it shut off. I press the gas and nothing is happening. Then my battery light turns on. I turn the car off, wait a few minutes, start it back up, everything seems normal. I drive for _NUMBER_ more minutes, same thing happens. I made it home and everything seems fine. However this keeps happening every couple minutes and now the check engine light is on as well. What could be the problem?
Hey everyone, As the title suggests, my Volvo is having fuel problems. While driving home today, the engine on my car shut off and I was forced to pull over. After investigating oil, temperature, and the other issues, I came to the conclusion that it might've been a problem with my fuel pump at the time. I was able to start my car, after a couple of tries and holding down the ignition for long and revving the gas quite a bit. The car then comes to a sluggish start and is drivable, but definitely not in an ideal state. Luckily I wasn't far from home so I was able to drive home. The diagnostic reading when I plugged in the computer was P0089. The screen read that the car had a "fuel pressure " problem. Anyone ever have this issue with their volvo? I will be investing the fuel filter, fuel pump and other related parts, but anyone have any suggestions on what to inspect first? Just looking to make this problem a bit easier. Thanks!
Hi friends, I'm struggling to fix the nasty _NUMBER_ year old window weatherstripping on my _NUMBER_ convertible, and am stuck. I spoke with a guy who has old Saab parts and he said it's basically impossible to get from old vehicles because it's glued into the door in a way that doesn't allow easy access. Any ideas of modern replacements for window weatherstripping for these old vehicles?
So just last weekend we had a huge storm that flooded many of our streets and I happened to be driving around and took in some water in the front. The car turned off when a big truck splattered tons of water on top of the hood and I noticed most of it went inside. I tried turning it on but the car would just make a nasty noise and wouldn't turn on so I had to get it towed. The foot brake was really hard. The car has been sitting out in the sun trying to dry for the past few days and today when the inspector from my insurance came to look at it we tried starting it again but the engine would just make a noise like if it wanted to start but would die. Any ideas of what it might be Update: the car started to run but would turn off then after trying to start it again it stayed on but gas smelling smoke would come out of exhaust and would penetrate the interior.
our house was hit by lightning last week and the charger does not seem to work anymore. it doesnt seem to have blown the fuse inside the charger as it powers up and then blinks red and blows the circuit breaker in the house. are there any resources to figure our how to fix this? Id rather try and fix it then spend $ _NUMBER_ on a new one.
So we're expecting a baby. Not giving up the Rubi. But my wife might need that little extra step to get up on in the Jeep. Not buying a cheap plastic stool... so perfect excuse for the Jeep obsession. Anyone have any rock rails that they'd swear by? Or swear at?
I know, FJ80 is old. _NUMBER_ to be exact, and I'm thinking when I go to college I'm gonna drop some money on a 4th or 5th gen 4Runner. Because holy shit these are beautiful. I've always loved 4Runners, was considering selling my Land Cruiser for a 3rd gen but I didn't see the point for the hassle. What are some Pros and Cons between the 4th and 5th gens? What years are 4th and what years are 5th? I can't find solid years anywhere haha
Holy smokes am I glad I joined the club... I've been driving mediocre cars for years, finally bit the bullet and stepped into the great beyond of 'decent motors'. I love the fact that I can overtake on the motorway with ease. I love the pure traction I get from all four wheels I didn't know what I was missing. It's a world apart from the 4x4 of my Jeep YJ, especially in the drivability department. I'd post pics of this machine but it's dark right now; not much point in looking at headlights and my sexy smoked tail lights. I'll get some up tomorrow for you all to enjoy. *edit: it is Turbo Tuesday guys n gals! Gimme some love here!
Hey everyone, I want to ask this question here before I go into a mechanic blind: When my _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ Mustang is cold to start to the day, it takes some heavy hammering on the gas while cranking the ignition to start. Typically it will start, then it will shut off. I'll have to repeat the process to get the car started up for good. After that, it slips into neutral _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ times while driving it in the first few minutes. When it slipped back into neutral I have to press down on the gas hard to get it back into drive. Eventually after I get the car to speed it will drive fine. Later in the day the car will start on the first crank and not slip into neutral after that... until the next day when the process starts again. Any idea on what exactly is causing this issue? Anything I can tweak with on my own before taking it into the shop? Thank you!
Hey r/Lexus, In the market for a new IS. I get an employee discount since I have a relative who works for Toyota corporate. I can get a _NUMBER_ IS _NUMBER_ F Sport for around 37k. I could also grab an IS _NUMBER_ w/ no f sport package for the same price. Both will be AWD since I live in an area that receives decent snowfall. Which would you go with? In a perfect world I would go with an IS _NUMBER_ F Sport but I want to keep the price I pay sub 40k. Thanks for the help. Edit: Thanks for all the help r/Lexus! Went to the dealer yesterday and put down a deposit on an IS _NUMBER_ F Sport in Nebula Gray. I'll be taking delivery on Friday. Cant wait!
QUESTION _NUMBER_ : Hi all! I just bought a _NUMBER_ Mazda _NUMBER_ iTouring with popular package today. I am excited to be driving this car now! I was trying to configure car settings and realized "maintenance wasn't set" What did you guys set for "Scheduled maintenance" "oil change" and "tire rotation" QUESTION _NUMBER_ : Is there only one 12V power outlet or are there two? If so, where is the second one? I only see one under the arm rest.
You will be ruined for all else. Case in point: My _NUMBER_ Cayman S is at the dealer for service (oil change, broken Bowden cable &amp;amp;amp; bracket in door) and I was given a courtesy vehicle. We'll give you something sporty, they said. I drove off the lot in a late model ruby-red Infinity Q60. Judging by the popularity of this car and others like it in my neighborhood, I figured in couldn't be half bad, right? This is supposed to be a "sports sedan" after all. The gulf couldn't be too great, could it? Much to my chagrin, after daily driving my Cayman for six months, it is now as if I've been thrust behind the wheel of a Sealy Posturepedic. Gone is the razor-sharp handling, intimate road feel, and perfect balance. It's as if I have taken off a pair of tight leather gloves and put on a pair of thick wool mittens. Corners are no longer dominated, but instead gingerly navigated like an Olympic speedskater intently crossing one skate over the other. The next thing I notice is that unmistakable flat-six gurgle and growl replaced by the burble unique to all Infiniti's. Its burble is not bad, but certainly no substitute. Worse, though, is the throttle response. Rather than the seemingly-linear power available at the flick of an ankle, when I press the accelerator on the Q60, very little happens, until a moment later when the turbo spools up and the stars in the foreground begin to blur and wipe towards the windscreen like the Millennium Falcon blasting into hyperdrive, and I am catapulted forward usually only to hit the brakes immediately as whatever momentary passing opportunity has already closed. Don't get me wrong, the Q60 is a nice car. The nav system, backup camera, and Bluetooth connections are all creature comforts I had forgotten about completely in my spartan _NUMBER_ . Nevertheless, I cannot say I will look back even once when I get it back later today, for I am now ruined on sports sedans (and everything else for that matter). Edit: the Q60 is not turbocharged, but the jerky _NUMBER_ -speed automatic nevertheless conveyed the sensations described above.
I don't know much about cars and am buying my first. Diesel Volkswagens are my top choice since my criteria is a wagon with very low mileage that will last for a bit. VW's seem to be very controversial cars though. A lot of people say to stay away from them entirely, why is this? I also hear that they're hard to find mechanics and parts for but I'm located on the northwest US coast and they seem pretty popular here and like finding a mechanic isn't really an issue, could that be a regional thing? I'm trying to do my homework and figure out what I need to know to make a smart purchase and I understand VW's seem to be quite specific in their maintenance needs and quirks. Would you say that as a first time car buyer I should avoid VW's entirely for this reason?
The astronomical high tide associated with last week's winter storm on the US East Coast flooded my _NUMBER_ Wrangler Unlimited. The claims adjuster just left and said, as with almost all saltwater flooded cars, it is a total loss. There is a lot of sentimental value that I have with my Wrangler and I don't know if I can let it go. Can it be restored? The adjuster said it's never recommended, but maybe with sentimental value, it may be worth it to some. I'm pretty emotional about it right now and am just looking for some logic and reason I guess.
I have a _NUMBER_ SC400 and I'm not sure what's wrong with the A/C. The A/C light is green and doesn't blink, the compressor turns on and off, radiator looks normal, but my car still blows warm air. I'm just hoping it needs to be recharged. What else could be wrong with it? I'm not sure exactly when it stopped working. I stopped using it last fall when the temps were comfortable enough to ride with the windows down. About _NUMBER_ months ago as it slowly started to warm up, I tried using it, but it wouldn't turn on. I then realized I had put the wrong fuse in for the radio/ac, which was blown. After I replaced it with the correct fuse, the A/C would turn on, but always be warm. And my system seems to still be using R12. I'm not sure if I want to switch to R134. Any help would be appreciated. I'm just asking because I won't have time to take it to the shop because of work. Plus I can't afford to fix it if it's over like $ _NUMBER_ .
I know the earlier versions (circa _NUMBER_ ) of ES350s would only brake if crash was _NUMBER_ % probable and it would only lessen the impact. But at some model year, the PCS starting fully braking to a stop if it sensed the car in front was going to crash. What model year did this start from? Thanks
So I am looking to buy a car in the next few months and I happened to stumble across this pristine looking Mercedes Benz _NUMBER_ C63 AMG, with brand new tires (summer and winter) and some bells whistles from a private dealer. It has a low 18k miles on it and seems in really good condition. The guy wants around $45k for it, which I probably will negotiate down. What do you guys think? How does maintenance cost? Any issues this car have that will make it expensive to keep? Warnings? Anything will help. Thanks!!
An indicator on the dash shows a warning that my Right side daytime running light has a problem. The light appears to be on but very dim. I assume I have to replace it? Can someone please confirm if that was the indicator means? Also is this something I can do myself or do I have to take it to the dealer. Thanks!
Just got quoted from the dealership that my _NUMBER_ bmw x5 _NUMBER_ has a oil filter housing leak. The thing is I had this replaced under cpo warranty less than two years ago. Now because I'm out of warranty they won't cover the part because the initial repair wasn't out of pocket! What are my options? They're charging me $ _NUMBER_ .
Hey everyone right now I drive a _NUMBER_ chevy cobalt. It's a pos and I'm tired of driving a clown car. I recently found a _NUMBER_ f150 fx4. It has 100k miles on it and it is being sold got 13k by the dealership here I'm thinking about trading in my car for this. How is it truck wise? I drove it and loved the way it Handled I just need advice as I have never had a truck.
Yesterday I was driving my _NUMBER_ xv crosstrek to work and something pretty strange happened. I was driving to work and had almost a full tank of gas and the digital gauge reflected that until all of a sudden I went from having a full tank of the gauge to having no fuel on the gauge and the fuel light flashing at me. Fearing the worst, I safely pulled over and assessed the situation. I took a vid of what was going on for future referance and, like magic, while filming, I had a full tank on the gauge again. After checking that the gas cap was on correctly, I wasn't leaking fuel and that my car still responded normally to throttle I set off again. This happened two more times before I arrived at work. Now, my first guess is that there is an issue with the fuel senser/float or that this is some sort of warning that something in the fuel system is going bad or needs replaced around 20k. Have any of you had this issue before or know what's wrong? I would appreciate your help Edit: Took her in to a dealership, showed the mechanic the video and they checked for error codes and maintenance letters but didn't find anything. The mechanic said that unless they can replicate what happened there isn't much he could do. They were very helpful and told me if the problem persists to bring it back and they'd have a go at it. Covered under warranty of coarse.
Hi, I'm a Subaru newbie and recently picked up a _NUMBER_ outback _NUMBER_ .5i to replace my _NUMBER_ jetta tdi. I was bored and decided I wanted keyless entry and a remote start option, so I just installed it this weekend. I thought everything was working. I went to move my car and noticed I couldn't shift out of park and the brake lights aren't lighting. I immediately checked the brake switch and it is working fine. I checked the STOP fuse and it is good. When I try to move the shift lever out of park I can hear a relay clicking, but I can't see it. The only thing I can think of is that I may have messed up something in while I was figuring out a good place in the dash to hide the brains of the viper system. I thought that maybe somehow the R/S system was erring, so I completely unhooked it, bridge the starter wires so electrically everything is how it was beforehand and I'm still stuck. Has anyone ran into this issue before? My google-fu is failing me hard on this one and I am in need of some ideas.
Ok does the community think _NUMBER_ .) The gts package is worth it over having ventilated seats _NUMBER_ .) Centerlock wheels yay or neigh? _NUMBER_ .) Front nose lift yay or neigh? _NUMBER_ .) Glass or metal sunroof? Then is there a must have package that the gts does not come standard with? Thanks, it's gonna be a long wait for this baby
Ugh. Shop just called and wifey's Tribeca needs a transmission. Its almost at 100k (no extended warranty). $ _NUMBER_ estimate on the tranny with 100k maintenance looming. I know my local dealer wants to move _NUMBER_ stock. What do you guys think? If we can get a great deal is it worth doing or should we fix the Tribeca? A new one would be our third Subaru, Thanks for reading.
Ok. So I got this shovelhead last week, and I've been going over the extra parts that came with it. I have a few milk crates holding the original engine. Looking through all this stuff I can see a good bit of rust. I'm not worried about the jugs and other miscellaneous stuff. My main concern is the bottom end. It's not split but I can see surface rust on the flywheels inside. I'd like to rebuild and reinstall it. Maybe sell the s&s in the bike. What should I expect to pay to have the bottom end rebuilt? Where should I take something like this? Thanks!
Fresh lurker here. Came across the volt in researching the prius plug in. LOVE all the tech in the Volt over what the prius has, as well as the much better price point for a car with lower miles. Anywho, I've found a couple of options I'm trying to decide between. First: _NUMBER_ Premier (fully loaded) with ~ _NUMBER_ miles for ~$ _NUMBER_ . It is only about _NUMBER_ minutes away and I'm heading over after work to crawl around it and see how I fit (I'm _NUMBER_ ' _NUMBER_ ") and it drives Second: _NUMBER_ Premier (also fully loaded) with ~ _NUMBER_ miles for ~$ _NUMBER_ . It has the lane departure warning and collision warning. BUT is _NUMBER_ states away about a _NUMBER_ hour drive. Also, carfax shows an accident reported. I'm torn as to which might be the better buy. I've read that the ' _NUMBER_ 's tend to be a quieter ride but have a slightly lower EV range under what the ' _NUMBER_ 's do. Any hints, thoughts, insights I should consider or issues I should look out for? Or small differences in options between the years that scream BUY ME!! Thank you in advance for any insights you guys have, I'm REALLY excited!
_NUMBER_ ES300 So today, all of the sudden, my radio only plays very softly out of the back speaker when the car is running. It is very bassy and you can barely hear the words. When I turn the car off, the speakers all play normally. The radio model is AVH-X2600BT. It has worked flawlessly for six months until today. Anyone have any idea what's wrong or what I should do? Thanks guys.
From what I've read there's no bluetooth audio with this model, but also read that you can buy an attachment for your navi for bluetooth without having to switch the whole thing? Also my it seems like there is no bass in my car and warranty isn't covering it. Is this a known problem?
The mirror adjustment switch has to be set to adjust the mirrors (not in the middle position)for that feature to work. I've had my _NUMBER_ IS250 for about _NUMBER_ months now. I knew I had seen my mirrors lower when putting it in reverse but it seemed to stop working from time to time. For about the last month it didnt work at all. Well, today I was in a situation where it would have been really nice to use that feature so I finally looked it up.
So I was on an online auction site and a _NUMBER_ Saab _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ came up. Supposedly it was donated and so the title is clean except for some DMV fees ($ _NUMBER_ ). Run and drive. It says its turbo charged but automatic. It's "Buy Now" price is only $ _NUMBER_ . It has 92k Miles. I don't know anyone that could give me some good advice other than you should see it before you make decision so I come here asking for your wisdom. Also this would be my first car.
Recently purchased myself a _NUMBER_ Triple Yellow Ecoboost with the Ecoboost Performance Package (should've went with the GT, but I ain't mad). I have no budget and I am looking for both performance and appearance mods. Going to make myself an ecobeast. Thank you! :)
I bought this car a few months ago.. I don't drive it much at night, but the instrument cluster lights do not work and I cannot see the dash at all. The turn signal light flashes, but everything else is dark. I cant seem to find anything about the light or how to replace it online. I don't want to start ripping stuff apart without having an idea of what needs replaced and where it is located. Anyone have experience with this?
I'm considering picking up at 3rd gen. I live in Chicago, but would prefer purchasing somewhere out of the rust belt (cali, texas, etc). I'd love to hear stories and/or advice on what you did to find your car. Why resources did you use to find your car (anything other than craigslist)? What pre-purchase questions did you find particularly helpful (assumption: you couldn't physically see the car)? I'm pretty familiar with the 4runner family. In a 4th gen at the moment and couldn't be happier.
Well the _NUMBER_ inches of rain in Northern California surfaced a huge leak in the new to me LX470 I'm in the process of drying out apparently this is a known issue with the third brake light foam gasket degrading over time allowing an internal leak that bypasses all gaskets unlimited info from google search. It is pretty sneaky leak check your cargo holds, back tailgate carpet etc. forewarned is forearmed. I still love the truck and I've learned how to take some of it apart without breaking _NUMBER_ tiny plastic parts a win in my book. Take care all loving all the F-Sport porn by the way!
Got a _NUMBER_ 4wd limited. The dreaded _NUMBER_ -wheel drive blink started on my dash, and it felt like the tires were locked in the differential and they wouldn't go back to positrack. Took it to a moderately reputable garage and they told me the electric motor(s) on the differential went out.They said they could just disengage them and let the car run in 2wd or... They quoted me $ _NUMBER_ for new electric motor, $ _NUMBER_ for used motor and $ _NUMBER_ for labor. Is this reasonable? Appreciate any input. Thanks!
I see a lot of people mention that N is useless because it doesn't regen but I live in a hilly area and it seems that I can coast quite a deal further without being in D. Since the regen can only capture your kinetic energy, and isn't _NUMBER_ % efficient, wouldn't logic dictate that N would have to be more efficient than using regen? N and regen both share drivetrain losses but N does not have any regen conversion losses. Anyone have any data on this? I always use D/L for braking but coasting seems to be a hotly contested issue.
I tried a search and couldn't find anything. Has anyone found a mod that could reliably increase the print speed. I'm using a V2 with the newest firmware. Would you need to change the stepper motors or belts or something. Better cooling? I'm printing a ton of OpenLOCK dungeon tiles for my D&D campaign and was hoping to cut the print time down a bit.
>Premium Compact Car: Chevrolet Volt >With better fuel efficiency, improved electric range, and a improved interior, the new Chevrolet Volt is the perfect vehicle for those looking to wade into the electric car segment. When Autoblog got a hold of the new Volt, we liked its overall range, stylish exterior, and striking exterior. >Unlike other electric vehicles, the Volt has an on-board generator that eliminates the dreaded range anxiety in other cars in the segment. Not only is the Volt cheaper than its rivals, it's also more comfortable and better looking. The new Volt is completely different than the previous model, which makes it an all-around winner in a segment that used to require drivers to compromise. _URL_
Hi all, I've been looking over _NUMBER_ minutes on google for a F Sport Exhaust installation tutorial. I have a _NUMBER_ IS350. Is anyone able to locate one/know about one they can share? Does a manual for installation come with the exhaust? Is there anything that needs to be done after installation in terms of maintenance \(such as retightening\)? Anything would help since I am new to cars and this is my first time changing anything on a car. I will be doing it with a friend who is knowledgeable, but hasn't done it himself before. Thanks!
I really want to pickup a low mileage (sub 70k) 535i xDrive wagon. _NUMBER_ was the final year that BMW imported theses beasts. What I want to know is, good car or error prone mechanic-bait? I have an ' _NUMBER_ 330ci that's been great to me, and I'm hoping to add a second friendly German to the garage -one that can hold the dog, skis and bikes!
So I just bought my Mustang last month and it's going to be going into storage next month. It's going to be sitting until April in a garage with a bunch of other cars and boats. My biggest question is what do you guys do when storing your cars for the winter? Should I leave the battery in it? How much gas should I leave in the tank? I'll fill it up right away with fresh fuel once I get it back on the road. Do dryer sheets really work for keeping mice away? I don't mind leaving a few around the car. Any other ideas and things to do are greatly appreciated. It's getting an oil change and cleaning a couple weeks before it goes into storage as well.
If so, how do you like it? Is it. Nice to be able to put In the rear as well? Is it too heavy to worry about doing? I'm making a front bumper out of a piece of _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ square tubing, and I'm probably going to put a receiver hitch In it as well. Would it be worth doing a cradle or should I just make a winch plate for the bumper. My biggest problem is I think I'm not gonna have enough room for a winch on the bumper. Thanks
Alright I have a question for you all. How much would it cost to go from mini apes to drag bars? I would need new cables, and i'm not sure how much that would cost. I tried searching up some answers but I couldn't get a definitive answer. I appreciate your time, thank you!
I'm not looking for pats on the back, I just wanted to comment that I sort of contradicted myself today. Maybe I'm a lame-o but I don't really care for the "Subaru Club" think, to me it's just a car. I think I'm bitter because of all the Harley Davidson fandom in my family. Anyway, I saw a Forester XT blow his right front tire out on the highway in front of me today. He was probably doing _NUMBER_ +, and I was one lane over from him when I noticed it smoking. Well, the tire shredded right off the rim, and it could have ended pretty bad, but he managed to get over to the right side. I would have tried to pull over regardless of what they were driving, but I felt *compelled* to do so as "badge brothers." Turns out the car was full, a couple kids in the back, and I guess the driver was handicapped so he wouldn't have been able to change the tire. I got their spare on fairly easily, and we chatted about our cars for a minute before got on our way. I joked and told him that if he had been driving a Chevy, I may not have stopped haha. I guess I am more hyper aware of other Subarus on the road. In order of collision awareness, my vigilance goes like: Motorcycles Expensive Cars Subarus Everyone else. Side note, thank you Subaru for not putting the *cheapest* emergency jacks in our cars, I have definitely seen worse. Everything is all bundled together nicely in there.
_NUMBER_ audi tt quattro _NUMBER_ , sensor in question is the longitudinal acceleration sensor (G251 on VAG). Its not so important,i am just really interested as to what can make the sensor throw a code like this. i live in switzerland and travel to italy several times per year... every time i go through the gotthard tunnel (16km long) (going either way),about half way through the tunnel..my abs and traction control light come on. i plug into vag-com and i get a longitudinal acceleration sensor code. It happens only and everytime i go through that tunnel, happened now the past _NUMBER_ times iv gone to italy( _NUMBER_ times through tunnel). weird eh? anyone have a guess as to why? _NUMBER_ Longitudinal Acceleration Sensor (G251). _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ Longitudinal Acceleration Sensor (G251): Implausible Signal.
I have a _NUMBER_ sportster and I am looking to put some work into it. The grand plan is to buy a more comfortable bike for longer hauls and have the sportster as a cooler bar hopper/custom bike. I have never done more than basic maintenance and am looking for ideas, tips, and suggestions. Here is what I have so far: "Baconator" a mini road king per se, _NUMBER_ upgrade, black bags, white fenders, windshield, cruiser bars, and larger tank. Ideally find a cool decal for the tank (pig in cops uniform, bacon strip with flames under "baconator" in vintage font, etc) dirty bobber, throw on a sissy bar, springer front end, and just an engine rebuild. Take off the front fender and paint the tank and rear fender matte black with _NUMBER_ " apes faux ironhead, tear drop intake, apes, bobbed fender, bare bones on controls and brakes, maybe more Thats as far as I have gotten. Any advice or ideas would be appreciated. Whats good to do at home and whats worth having a shop get done? Were there any pitfalls you had during your customization that you wish you knew about before you started? Thanks for any help. I really love the bike, but I think with a top end rebuild coming up it would be a good time to really make the bike mine. Also, I have a few buddies that have worked on harleys as well as a mechanic from the local dealership that does work on the side. I don't have an unlimited budget but I anticipate doing this over time.
Fellow Porsche Enthusiasts, I am about to buy my first ever Porsche. Before making the final decision however, I feel that I could use some wise words from knowledgeable "Porsche-people" and this place seemed like the most obvious one to ask around. I would like to buy a daily driver and based on my budget ( _NUMBER_ -75k EUR, which is equivalent to _NUMBER_ -90k USD), I have the following choices: • A **two-years-old Cayman S** with _NUMBER_ -30k km / _NUMBER_ -20k miles (this would be the cheapest option) • A **four-years-old _NUMBER_ Carrera S** with _NUMBER_ -50k km / _NUMBER_ -30k miles (this is the most expensive option) • A **ten-years-old _NUMBER_ Turbo** with _NUMBER_ -50k km / _NUMBER_ -30k miles (this is in the middle price-wise) **So, based on the below mentioned concerns and decision factors, what would you recommend? Which car should I buy and why?** My most important concerns: • *headroom:* I am _NUMBER_ cm tall (for US redditors: _NUMBER_ feet _NUMBER_ inches) and I had a difficult time squeezing myself into some of the cars I have tried at the local dealership. I don't fit in the _NUMBER_ Turbo and in the _NUMBER_ Cayman (my head touches the roof in both of these cars). I had no problems in the _NUMBER_ Carrera and in the _NUMBER_ though. According to the dealer it depends on the seat: some seats leave less space between them and the roof. • *power:* so far I have only driven the base _NUMBER_ Cayman and I was a bit disappointed. I expected more from a Porsche, it didn't feel more powerful than my current _NUMBER_ litre turbodiesel Skoda. ( _NUMBER_ HP and _NUMBER_ Nm). This is why I haven't considered any of the base models. • *transmission:* I have zero experience with automatic transmissions. I have driven manuals all my life. I like that I have more control in a manual and the automatic cars I have driven so far were very bad (these were cheap rental cars). However, I am told that the PDK is much better than older automatic systems, you are still allowed to select the gears with the paddles and it is very good in choosing the appropriate gear based on your driving style. I have also been told by the dealer that the manual can be a bit annoying if it's used as a daily driver, as the clutch is quite heavy. It would be great if you could provide me with some input for the automatic/manual decision. My most important decision factors are the following (in priority order): _NUMBER_ . *headspace:* I don't want my head to touch the roof of the car _NUMBER_ . *power:* I want a car that is considerably more powerful than my current one _NUMBER_ . *depreciation:* I would like to have a car that that won't loose its value too fast. I am planning on keeping the car for a long time (> _NUMBER_ years), but it might happen that I will have to sell it earlier due to some unforeseen circumstances _NUMBER_ . *maintenance costs:* I wouldn't like to spend too much money/time at the workshop _NUMBER_ . *fuel consumption:* as I will drive it a lot in the city so this might also be an
As the title says, I'm finally getting to replace my totaled Mustang I lost back in December. I am looking at a _NUMBER_ _NUMBER_ .7L V6 Ti-VCT 24V White Convertable. Does anyone have any experience with these or know what I should be looking out for at the dealership? I'm going myself as a young woman and don't want someone to miss anything hidden I should know about. Thanks!!
Hey all, I just got myself into a _NUMBER_ 320i fully loaded msrp about 42k. Black with black interior. I was in a _NUMBER_ Grand Cherokee Overland on a _NUMBER_ year lease with about _NUMBER_ years left on it paying _NUMBER_ a month. Just for giggles I checked my residual and much to my surprise It was only 31k and the car was valued between 32k and _NUMBER_ . So I went to BMW as they were advertising a red 320i for _NUMBER_ plus like 3k down. I didn't like red so i got them to search and they found this black fully loaded one and we worked the numbers and we ended up getting it down to a _NUMBER_ year lease, _NUMBER_ down for _NUMBER_ a month. We didn't know if this was a good deal since we are new to BMW so we went to another dealership right after and asked if they could match or beat that price... they didn't have any units with the same features but they still ran the numbers on a lesser vehicle and then the manager came to us and said "I have no idea how you got that price over there but that's probably the best deal we have ever seen... you need to RUN, not walk back to that dealership and see if they still honor that price because we think it's a mistake" Needless to say, we went back right after and got the deal. Ended up getting out of my lease _NUMBER_ years early, and into a brand new 320i for almost _NUMBER_ less than my current payment and on only a _NUMBER_ year lease with _NUMBER_ down! Nobody was lying when they said BMWs have a special feel to them when driving... by far the smoothest car I've ever drove. Only downside is now I might be locked into the BMW habits and keep wanting to upgrade cars and before I know it will be about to drop 80k on a car _EMOJI_
Hey Guys, I want a little more cool look to my ' _NUMBER_ XC70 and i'm wondering if I should buy a V70R tailgate spoiler for it. From this link I can get it in the exact color of my XC but it's pretty pricey and I'm not sure if it will fit and haven't been able to see if the tailgates are the same on the same generation wagons. Any help is appreciated!
Hi guys, I have recently bought a Lexus GS300 _NUMBER_ . year and have noticed this weird idling. On a cold start it is idling just fine, something like _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ RPM (which I also thought is a little bit low as normally it should go above 1k at least for a moment) but after some driving and around _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ of the temperature gauge it drops idle to something like _NUMBER_ and seems to stall, whole car vibrates a little, well, you know what I mean, but while standing and once it goes above _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ close to _NUMBER_ / _NUMBER_ (as normal operating temperature) the idle goes back to normal _NUMBER_ as it should and it is just fine after that. Do you guys know what could be the issue and where to start looking at? It annoys me a little bit, but other than that I love the car though.
I was looking to give my A1 a makeover to hopefully make it look a bit sportier but on a budget if anyone has any ideas? I'm _NUMBER_ and although I love the interior and performance, the exterior looks a bit boring and more feminine as some say. Current look The _NUMBER_ door aspect doesn't help but the car was very cheap at the time due to a mistake from the dealership so I didn't hesitate. I was thinking at possibly lowering the suspension as the rear suspension seems to rise compared to the front and it's fairly high making it not look too good, is this possible?
I'm totally new to 3d printing. The printer was in the mail today (Maylan m200) so I was excited to unpack and set it up. But now I'm kind of stuck since the nozzle seems to be blocked. I tried heating up to _NUMBER_ °C and pushing filament in (I have a roll of PLA). there were a few little drops of some white filament oozing out but nothing more. so.. what now? update _NUMBER_ : I used guitar string to gently poke from below through the nozzle. The blockage seems to be above the hot end inside the little metal tube reaching out of the hot end at about the position of the lower grub screw. still no Idea how to get it out... update _NUMBER_ : Oh boy.. so I tried pulling the blockage out by pushing the PLA in, letting it cool and then pull it out. The PLA broke and not there is some PLA ABOVE the original blockage (d'oh). So I'm calling it a day. tomorrow I need to buy a fitting hex key to disassemble the block. Quite frustrating, but this way, I'm learning a lot about the printer and as far as I understand, this is part of the 3d printing experience. So any tipps on the disassembly? I don't want to remove the nozzle unless it's absolutely necessary. update _NUMBER_ : okay, I managed the get the blockage out. Now I finally can start exploring the world of 3d printing. On other thing came up. The lever for the extruder broke, but luckily i can still use it with a clamp. And the first thing my printer is producing is a replacement lever... what an awsome machine!
Looking for advice on this minor issue. I have already scheduled an appointment with the dealership next week but I wanted to see if this issue would be covered under the CPO warranty as my OG warranty exp last month. A couple weeks ago I noticed a considerable amount more wind noise coming from behind my left shoulder while driving on the freeway. After having a look and raising the top and windows down a few times while comparing both drivers and passengers side together it looks like my rear drivers side window is coming up to far and causing the front window to over lap the rubber seal where it should normally sit possibly causing the noise. Has anyone had any issues with something like this before? Will the parts be covered under the CPO warranty? I looked through the warranty and customer info and they mentioned minor wind noise and insignificant seepage but to me it clearly looks like some window alignment went off kilter.
I bought it mid November. In late December I went on a _NUMBER_ week vacation leaving the car outdoor but I left it plugged in. At some unknown time during those _NUMBER_ weeks the 12v battery crapped out and the car completely lost all power. When I got back I had to use the emergency key to get it opened as it was unresponsive. Called a OnStar and got a tow truck to boost me. The car ran fine but as soon as I got to work and turned it off it lost full power. The engine was on and it made a loud noise as it stopped abruptly. So not only am I worried that the engine will have issues but because it was off during that really cold snap with multiple days of _NUMBER_ celcius I'm also worried for the batteries. What should I do? The dealer replaced the 12v and it works now but I feel as though they should at least do more to let me know that it didn't deteriorate the battery pack. Any suggestions?
Looks like I can only get the red brake light bulbs online. Is the fog light bulb the same that is on the trunk? Thinking of pulling that out and putting in the brake light. Also, does anyone know what the deal is with those fog lights on the trunk? There is only one bulb and it doesn't even turn on
I was literally a day away from (finally, after saving for it) ordering an Old Man Emu lift kit, but I have terrible luck and my fuel pump died on my way to work yesterday. So, most of my money for that is going towards the repair and rental car, because again, with my luck, no one has the part around here and it has to be shipped. -_- But I need to replace my suspension asap, because it's f*cking terrible; I literally avoid offroading because it gives me a headache lol. So I'm looking for something that's affordable and decent, because I DO plan on getting that lift kit, but don't want to spend $$$ on a good replacement stock suspension only to replace it with the OME kit. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
Hi, I have a _NUMBER_ v40 sport estate, it has the head unit with CD player and cassette but I would like to upgrade it to a newer unit that I can use with my phone for hands free. Any suggestions on what model headunit are a straight swap to fit in the gap where it is? Thank you in advance.
The Select Mini V2 was my first hands-on with any 3D printer. To get me going immediately, I first ensured that the bed was leveled. Next I printed the cat that came on the SD card .. figuring this was probably also the manufacturer's test model. If it prints perfect the first time, then you can "auto-create" a great profile starting point. Open Cura and in the File menu you can load a profile from an existing gcode file. Just load the cat.gcode's profile and most likely this will produce prints that are satisfactory. Back it up and then tweak to your liking knowing that you have a solid starting point. Next I'll be researching these rumored magic numbers for this printer :D
Preface: You can never sell or trade the vehicle and you don't have to pay for it. It's given to you free under one condition you must keep it your whole life. Market values past present and future do not apply. _NUMBER_ GT3 RS or _NUMBER_ GT3 RS _NUMBER_ Which one?
It's been a long time since I've owned a sporty Honda, and have decided that I want to jump into one for a project car. I'm in the states, but Honda-Tech seems to have really died down the past few years in the Marketplace side. Are there any other resources I should look at besides C/L for parts and cars online? Thanks!
select mini V2. Printed this _URL_ This is the first thing that I tried to print after the cat file that comes with it. I followed the Cura set up instructions, but it was confusing because the manual does not show the current version of Cura or the current version of software in the printer. If anyone has settings that they use to print things off of thingverse that would be much appreciated. Again I am brand new at this and trying to learn. Thanks community
The end of trip screen. Twice a year I drive from Ohio to Massachusetts to visit family, a _NUMBER_ + mile trip one way. This is the first such trip since I picked up my ' _NUMBER_ Volt. I love long drives, so I was eager to try this in the Volt. There's no question it CAN be done, but I was curious if I could make the trip comfortably and hit my usual refueling spots. Turns out, it can be done reasonably well. The above numbers were with cruise control set at 73mph (118kph) for the majority of the trip and with the AC set to 72F (22C) in ECO mode. I used the battery for travel off the highway and for acceleration to cruising speed where I would then switch to Hold mode to get the most from the ICE engine. This is by far the best mileage I've ever had in a car I've owned. I was pretty stable at _NUMBER_ .3mpg until I hit the mountains in eastern MA, so I averaged only _NUMBER_ for the trip. But since my goal was 37mpg+ to hit my planned refueling stints, this was very impressive to me. Not using gas to accelerate to cruising speed and the Voltec design allowing an Atkinson cycle engine to stay in it's most efficient range really helped. _NUMBER_ + mpg from a 3500lb car doing 73mph with AC running is damn good. There were a couple things I discovered: Most importantly, the Volt will use the battery to supplement the power the ICE is generating for acceleration. The majority of the EV mileage in the picture was done while in Hold mode! I would see the engine recharging the battery a little bit, but not enough to replenish all that was used. I had more than enough for my trip, but I think that if I were to attempt a 1000mi trip I would have to either use mountain mode to maintain acceleration and sacrifice gas mileage, or let the charge hit zero and run in basically a limp mode. Not a big deal, since I think a _NUMBER_ hour trip is my limit. The fuel door can be opened while the car is still on! This was both surprising and helpful. It was nice being able to leave the car on for my Wife while I refueled. The Gen _NUMBER_ Volt doesn't need a bug deflector. Usually on these trips in the summer the whole front of the car will be covered in dead bugs. This time, I thought there just weren't many bugs out this year. But at the end of the trip I found that the nose was covered in bug splats, but the windshield was nearly clean. Seems the aerodynamics are just about perfect to keep bugs from impacting on the windshield at highway speeds. I've owned an Audi and a Cadillac in the past. The Caddy had GM's magnetic dampers which are considered some of the best for ride quality. My Volt was almost as nice to road trip in as either of those cars for half the price. Ride quality is great and cabin noise levels are superb. My only gripe is that the seat could use more adjustment options. Can't wait for the trip home. I am concerned about doing this trip in the winter, however. Anyone know if the HVAC system uses the coolant for heat if the ICE is running? I may need to do some practice runs when the temperatures drop. The more I drive this car the more I'm impressed with it and surprised by how much I'm actually enjoying it. It's convinced me that EVs are the perfect car for short trips around town, and now this ICE/EV arrangement like a diesel locomotive seems to be a great configuration for long trips. My only wish is that the fuel tank was a little bigger ( _NUMBER_ -15gal) and that the Voltec drivetrain was available in a more fun/luxurious body. But overall, I think the Volt is the hidden gem of GM's lineup.
Hey gents, it looks like I'll be buying a _NUMBER_ Bullitt this week. It's in great shape, the only minor problem is that it's black, but I can live with that. I'm already thinking of some (mostly aesthetic) mods to do. I'm thinking about getting black headlights and rear black sequential rear lights to add to the sinistre look of this beast. What do you guys think, and to Bullitt owners, what kind of mods are you rocking?
Hello, I believe my daughter threw away the keys to the Jetta on accident. That was my only set, and the dealer is saying they need the car there (half hour drive away) to make another key, plus charging a small fortune. Do I have any other options then to tow the car down there?
So, I recently leased an ' _NUMBER_ S5 Sportback. It's at the dealer for a Pre Sense failure warning (long story). I got an ' _NUMBER_ A5 Sportback as a loaner and I honestly am enjoying driving it more than the S5. The S5 is my first 'performance' luxury type car, so getting used to it might be part of it. But the transmission on the A5 is much more responsive and linear. It actually reacts like how I'm used to on cars and doesn't go from _NUMBER_ to rocket like on the S5. Much smoother to drive in regular traffic or around town. On the S5, I feel like a jackass as the brakes are also super grabby and the car seems to be jerking around while accelerating and slowing down. When I push in the pedal, it's super slow and all of a sudden it goes super fast. Just no happy medium on the S5. I'm actually having some regret that I didn't get the A5 over the S5. Never thought I would regret buying a faster car!
I am involved with a smaller community airport. We are completely open to the public and have a decent amount of regulars that use the airport on top of larger annual events. I was asked to reach out to Tesla about getting information from them about the destination charger program and filled out the form but never go so much as a single response from them. Any idea if this is normal?
I've had my GS300 for a little over a year now, but when I bought it the nav disc was MIA. I saw the correct ones on ebay and amazon but in a clublexus thread I saw people mention that the cheap ones (specifically with a sticker, not printed text) can damage the reader in my trunk? Does anyone have any knowledge on this? tl;dr I want to get a knockoff nav disc, is there anything I should look out for?
I own an early-model S60. I've had it since _NUMBER_ , so it has the typical early adopter problems: it's lacking all the new polish and features that rolled out after the initial builds. Hell, I live in Boston, and there was no option for all-wheel drive or a cold weather package when I bought it. I'm looking to upgrade to a S90D soon, but I don't want to buy it if the hardware is going to be obsolete in the very near term. How soon do we think Autopilot _NUMBER_ hardware will ship?
I'm trying to get a _NUMBER_ sGT in one of a few different standard colors. The only additional add-on I want is mobile start ($ _NUMBER_ ). I've been going back and forth with a dealer online. I'm trying to get it at $ _NUMBER_ OTD, which he says is impossible. I disagree. Any body know of any success at this price point? With the _NUMBER_ models about to hit, I would think they're motivated to move what is now a year old car.
Good morning all, in the process of cleaning my _NUMBER_ YJ _NUMBER_ .0L I stumbled upon what looks like a 120v standard three prong plug with cable that disappears into the block. It was coiled and zip tied to the firewall. I'm assuming this is a long lost block heater? I'm in Florida now so I don't have a need for it but I know I will in the future. Couple things, how do I tell if it's safe to use? Plug it in and see what happens? PO didn't know it was there and I bought it in Hawaii so I know it hasn't been used for _NUMBER_ + years. I looked in the manual, didn't see much, any special oil recommendations? Any routine maintenence required? Thanks for all the help!!
I purchased a _NUMBER_ with ceramic breaks about _NUMBER_ months ago and I've noticed sporadic squeaking coming from the brakes. I've heard that squeaky ceramic brakes is common, but it seemed to be squeaking much more than I would expect. Maybe a coincidence, but I haven't heard the brakes since the car had the brake fluid flushed with a major maintenance it received last week. Is it possible new brake fluid reduced the squeaking? The dealer said pads still had _NUMBER_ % left.
I'm in the market to buy my first full size truck. I'm not planning on towing regularly, but the extra bed space and size of a full size in my opinion seems to be worthwhile. A little background: I'm trying to stay below $35K, and 4wd is a must given snow, etc. where I live. I also would prefer an access/quad cab rather than a full four door truck. Other than that, I'm open to a V6 or a V8. I'm looking for advice on reliability/long term drive quality given that I can obviously only test drive these. I've driven the following (listed in no particular order) and would love anyone's feedback or advice on a different truck. _NUMBER_ . _NUMBER_ Chevy Silverado _NUMBER_ Custom _NUMBER_ .3L V8 (double cab) _NUMBER_ . _NUMBER_ Ram _NUMBER_ Express _NUMBER_ .6L V6 (quad cab) _NUMBER_ . _NUMBER_ Ford F150 XL _NUMBER_ .7L V6 Ecoboost (super cab) Obviously the Chevy had the V8, but ride quality and even power up some steep hills honestly felt the same compared to the _NUMBER_ .6L V6 in the Ram and the Ford Ecoboost. I can get the Ram for about 4K cheaper than the Chevy and 2K cheaper than the Ford, but again, being my first full size, I'd love some opinions on longevity and anything I might be missing from the list I've already driven. Thanks!
So I was riding to work a couple weeks ago and the bike just died. Pulled over to the side without getting run over, thank goodness. Engine light was on and the bike wouldn't turn over. I figured something simple, electrical. Got the bike to my shop and pulled a MAP code. Ok, thats easy. Pulled the manual and read and said to try to start the bike. So I did. It cranked over slowly, _NUMBER_ times, and then stopped. Seized. Great. Got the bike to my old dealer and they got it torn apart and this is what they found. Basically the valve broke in half then pinballed around my cylinder. The crank seized as well. They're assessing the extent of the damage now. Here is the spark plug. Pretty damn wild. Anyone ever seen this before? Either way everyone simultaneously enjoys and is saddened by bike carnage so I figured I'd share mine.
Does anyone have any information on the speaker size used in the Premium (non-B&O) B9 A4s? I went with the premium package with the plan of upgrading the speakers myself at some point and haven't been able to find any information on speaker size online anywhere. Thanks!
I originally ordered an open box V2 from MP, my first mistake. It was junk, and they didn't even send a power supply with it. So I sent it back and finally got the replacement on Friday. It looks brand new, however as I was leveling the bed and testing out all of the axis controls from the menu, it clicked off. It wouldn't turn back on for a while, so I tried a different surge protecter and wall outlets. Occasionally I could get it to click back on long enough to get the head to home axis to level the bed. However I haven't gotten it back on in a few days. I was thinking a bad power supply because I've heard they're notorious for sending out bad ones. Could it also be a firmware issue or something loose with the board? I'm gonna call MP before I crack it open but I was wondering if anyone had any opinions from what I've described. If I was to just buy my own power supply, can someone explain if the 12V 10A power bricks are safe because the parts website wasn't very clear about that PS They sent me a V1 (the second time, after I called specifically to tell them they sent me the wrong version printer) when I ordered a V2, so it might be going back just for that. If that's the case I'm just going to go with a DIY kit
My V2 was delivered on Sunday, I got it to work printing off the heater wire rerouting parts. But when I came to open it up I realised the inside didn't look like the videos I'd seen online the wires to the heated bed go through a long hole with a lining, and are wrapped in a sleeve. There doesn't appear to be any strain on the wires as the bed moves. Also noticed on the underside of my bed there's what looks like thermal insulation that I don't see in the videos. Apologies if this is a well known revision , I didn't see any like mine when I was googling around before picking it up and I still see people advising new owners to do the bed rerouting.
Just wondering if anyone else have had this problem. I have a check engine light and the tech that looked at it says I have to replace the vapor cannister. Look it up online and it's $ _NUMBER_ for the part!! Has anyone else had issues with this? Any chance the car is throwing a code for some other (cheaper) reason? It's a _NUMBER_ 4Runner Sport
I remember hearing years ago about automatic transmissions being bad for drivetrain loss to the wheels and that manual transmissions were more efficient at transferring the power to the wheels. Is this true with newer automatics like the dual clutch PDK unit? Would a manual _NUMBER_ dyno the same numbers as a PDK _NUMBER_ ?
Just picked up my car this past Monday and I know for certain it wasn't clicking until yesterday evening when I drove home from work. Clutch clicks around the bite point when depressing and releasing the pedal (Sounds similar to this: _URL_ I've read a number of posts and it seems to be a somewhat common issue. So my questions are: _NUMBER_ . The car only has _NUMBER_ miles on it. Am I good waiting until I bring it in for my post break-in period oil change to bring it up to the service dept. or should I bring it in now? _NUMBER_ . Have any other recent owners experienced this? Some of the posts I've read made it sound like Subaru was aware of the issue and it got sorted. Appreciate any insight you guys can give!
New _NUMBER_ LT at full charge and just a short trip to the grocery so I thought I'd play around on Sport mode. Sitting at the light, I stomped on it and the front wheels broke free and gave a nice little squeal, continued and glanced down to 120kw being supplied to the motor. If you don't care about using up some charge, this car is FUN in sport mode.
Bouncing back and forth between lifiting or lowering my _NUMBER_ blob eye wagon. My current hang up with lifting it is that I would need new rims, tires and mudflaps but after looking at some others pictures I might just need new tires and flaps. Curious what size wheels people are running on theirs and what size tire you're able to clear.
I was offered a _NUMBER_ V6 manual in a trade for my motorcycle and I am wondering what I should be on the lookout for. The body is in surprisingly good shape for being in the midwest I don't know about the frame I will check that out when I see it in person. I just want to make sure it doesn't seem too good to be true
So I'm posting to see if anyone else has had this problem with their 4th gen. I know saying "heard this sound coming from my engine" doesn't help but thats what was happening. It was like some motor sound spinning for the first _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ seconds then stops. I have done some research and believe it to be my smog pump. which i wasnt even aware that was a thing. Later I learn Toyota installed smog pumps on 4runners because their emission levels upon start up were really bad for the first minute or so. To ~~solve~~ get around this Toyota simply added a pump that pumps clean air into your exhuast, thus diluting your emissions; Which doesn't really solve the problem at all but somehow seemed like a good idea. I looked into repairing/replacing my smog pump only to realize they are stupid expensive. I think my real problem is that some of the valves in the system are messed up and not working, leaving only a few to handle everything, making the pump have to work overtime to pump enough air through fewer tubes, which is why I can hear the pump all of a sudden. So i guess i just have a few questions. frist, what the fuck toyota? second, is it bad to just not fix my smog pump? I live in Montana and we don't have to pass emission tests for registration, but i have lived in places previously that do require it. Its not putting out more emissions total, just more at one time. Has anyone else had this problem? what did you do? sorry for my rambling post. any and all help is very much appreciated. I could be _NUMBER_ % wrong about all of this btw, i am no expert. obligatory picture of my baby affectionately named "Rockwood the Mother Fuccker" (not a typo, theres two C's)
Im seeking opinions and what thoughts are between the _NUMBER_ style racks. I am In the process of custom fabricating a design but am not sure which route to go down. I love the look of the basket style racks like the gobi but a utility rack seems more ideal longer items like I will be carrying (paddle Boards, kayaks, surfboards, Snowboards) but the idea of cargo style seems to give me a better "piece of mind" of small items being secured from moving when I don't necessarily have longer items with me. I am considering a "hybrid" design in which the rack is designed in the basket style like a gobi stealth, but the floor is removable and can be placed on the top level of the rack for said longer items or a tent. But I can't seem to figure out a strong way to make them removable like gobi's removable crossbars but possibly too weak? Or some scaffolding style T Clamps? The heaviest that will be up there will be me and a tent (200lbs) Appreciate the input everyone!
I want to know if any of you guys have had to replace the manual on a _NUMBER_ Mustang. Would it be better to go aftermarket, or just get the stock transmission. Anyone have an idea of how much each would cost? Any info would be fantastic! Wanted to get a jump before I take my car in to the dealer/shop.
I bought a new trunk for my _NUMBER_ .8t. I'm having trouble with it closing and opening correctly. It latches only if I slam it hard. The trunk came from a b5 4motion. I'm assuming they are exactly the same. But can someone verify? It will not open unless I reach in through and pull the emergency trunk release. I swapped the latch mechanism, off my old trunk, and the lock as well. Did I mess something up on my end? Any help would be appreciated.
Hey all, _NUMBER_ y/o here wanting to lease my first car and retire my _NUMBER_ Tucson. I have it narrowed down to the _NUMBER_ Tucson and _NUMBER_ Mazda Cx- _NUMBER_ . I'm heavily leaning towards the Tucson and am really interested in the SE plus. My wish list for my new car is pretty simple: solid gas mileage (I drive about _NUMBER_ miles a day to work), leather seats, android auto, a smooth drive. I was originally going for the limited at around $ _NUMBER_ , but the SE plus seems like a really great, cost-efficient option. The SE plus has everything on my checklist with the main differences between the SE plus and the Limited being the engine. I don't really think I care for a turbo charged engine. I don't really drive that fast (maybe _NUMBER_ on the way to work) and don't need a quick pickup. I've heard the Tucson has some problems with stop and go traffic and my work route usually has no traffic. In the end, I really love the way my _NUMBER_ Tucson drives so I feel like anything I get now will be an improvement on that. With the SE plus being such a great price (I calculated mine on the website for around $ _NUMBER_ /mo after offers/trade in/etc while the Limited was almost $ _NUMBER_ more a month), does it make more sense to get the SE plus or is the Limited really worth it? Side question, how accurate is the calculator on the hyundai website? Can I expect similar results in dealerships (Westchester Country NY area) or will it be better/worse? Thanks for the help and taking the time to read this post! Edit: sorry for the ugly uncapitalized title. It was doing it by itself when I made the post and went away for some reason lol
I'm sure the answer is going to be, "You're an idiot and didn't do ____." But I'd rather ask here then be made a fool at the dealership/mechanic. I keep my _NUMBER_ ' _NUMBER_ in the garage during the winter. I start her up and run idol ever week for about 5min to keep the gas from getting weird but haven't winterized her fully because I live in CO where you never know when a _NUMBER_ degree day will hit. I ran her idol for _NUMBER_ -10min last night with no issues and tonight as I went to fire it up for one of those 60degree Colorado winter evenings... I'm just getting a clicking sound and she won't turn over. All other electronics are fine, full tank of gas, and it doesn't matter if I'm in neutral or first. YouTube is telling me that my battery is dead and I'll have to replace it. Any other "check this first" recommendations from the more experienced guys here would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance and again, sorry for the ignorance.
Things aren't _NUMBER_ % clear on the website and there seems to be so many packages to choose from. The vehicle seems very nice. I'm curious of owners of the Tuscon are happy with it and I want XM (which I was told is available with the base package) But I also want Android Auto. I'm just not _NUMBER_ % clear which trim or whatever add the Android Auto. And from a couple of my wife's friends who have purchased a Hyundai, the seem pretty competitive on deals and pricing to sell a car. My credit is decent and I'll have a so-so down payment. (hoping to have around $ _NUMBER_ ) Any input on this car or advice would be appreciated.
New to Harley's and I just bought a _NUMBER_ ironhead project. It's pretty much a basket case but my first priority is figuring out the wiring and just go ahead and get that out of the way before I start messing with everything else. What are some good resources for learning about batteries, ignition, alternators/generators, etc.? And what are some lessons y'all have learned that might save me some headache down the road?
Got a _NUMBER_ Accord Hybrid last year, love it. But there is something odd we've noticed. When in electric modes, at very slow speeds, there is a sort-of musical sound coming from under the hood. Like pulling into the driveway, if someone is standing there, they hear it. Slowing at a red light, people next to us with their windows open, you can tell they hear it. Rolling through a drive-through, with the window open, you can hear it. Reminds us of Windows sounds, computerized music-y. We wondered if it was to make noise so people could hear it in electric mode, as it is essentially silent. But it isn't loud enough, you'd have to be within _NUMBER_ feet or less to hear it. Can anyone help explain it? Dealer is no help, this is the first hybrid Accord they've ever seen. Just so weird...
So long story short I bought a Nissan _NUMBER_ Altima this January, but the dealer didn't fully disclose history about a buy back. When I found this out this week I called the GM of my dealer and he immediately offered to buy my car back and let me pick something else off of the lot. I saw a _NUMBER_ Civic Hybrid for $ _NUMBER_ on the lot. I liked my Altima, but the civic is known for longevity, and I would like to hold on to my next daily for many years to come. Is it worth it to buy a civic hybrid, or should I just buy another Altima for a little more? I heard that the civic hybrids have had some bad batteries? Also heard they are a bit sluggish on the freeway. Thanks for any advice!
So I received a call from onstar that said I had limited services. Then I heard the normal "connecting to Onstar" then disconnected with the usual message after about _NUMBER_ seconds. About a minute later my radio turned off completely for about _NUMBER_ min before turning itself back on. Has anyone else had anything like this happen before?
Hi, I'm looking into buying a new _NUMBER_ hatchback. Went to the dealer and loved the looks, space and acceleration. Just as I was ready to get one, I did some search over the internet and found all kinds of complaints about the _NUMBER_ model with rattling sounds coming from A-pillar and dashboard. I got a bit concerned and wonder if this is fixed in the _NUMBER_ model? I didn't notice it when test driving but maybe I was too excited with the hhp and acceleration. Thanks!
I'm having an issue with a brand new Genesis G90. The trunk won't open by using the key fob, trunk release button on the dashboard or even by hand release. The only way I can open it is by using the actual key. Dealership is telling me something probably got skipped in the PDI process but I am unable to take it to the dealership because it is a display vehicle for an upcoming event. Any suggestions?
Fell in love with this thing from first test drive. Everyone I have talked to or have met in the Jeep community has been amazing. I didn't think a vehicle could have such an impact on my life. Thanks to everyone for being awesome. Here is an album of modifications/adventures from my first year or so: _URL_ First time at an ORV Park a few weeks ago: _URL_
I have an A4 B5 Avant that I am unfortunately looking to sell. I just can't keep putting the money into this car that I want to and I need to find something that has a lower cost of maintenance. I'm having trouble finding what Avants go for these days so I was wondering if any of you Audi gurus knew what a reasonable asking price would be? The car is in decent condition. Paint has a few small chips and dings. I just cleaned out the oil screen 5k miles ago due to the oil sludge problem that plagues these cars. It is likely that there is a small vacuum leak causing it to idle rough upon startup but besides that it runs fine. Let me know what your thoughts are, thanks!
_URL_ I drove the Miata and my Fiance drove my Mazda3. It was both of our's first time. So, I'm sure we both have tons of room for improvement, but she was right on my ass with the Mazda3, just _NUMBER_ hundredths of a second behind in time. With proper summer tires and an experienced driver, it would be pretty competitive. _TAG_ shoutout to BF Goodrich Sport Comp2 All Seasons
Have the FWD _NUMBER_ Tucson Eco which didn't come with a trailer hitch (not a vehicle for towing) and looking at options for bike racks. Weighing costs to install hitch or rack rails but both are $ _NUMBER_ or more. Any current owners in this sub using a trunk rack? Looking for recommendations.
First: I understand that Drive Pilot is NOT an autonomous driving feature. Driver attention is still required at all time. What I want to know is does the Drive Pilot: works well in a stop-and-go traffic on a freeway? help ease the pain of a long commute ( _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ miles each way)?
Hi guys, I've been experiencing an issue with my rear left blinker on my _NUMBER_ Sierra. All the lights are working but for some reason when I turn on my left blinker nothing happens with the rear light and I get the extra fast flasher on my dashboard. Additionally, when I turn on the _NUMBER_ ways the turn signals on my dash both stay in the on position. I'm assuming this is due to the left blinker not functioning properly. I've taken a look at the relay and it seems to be functioning fine no corrosion or damage. Plus all my other turn signals work. I've been trying to research trouble shooting tips but short of replacing the indicator switch, relay or the left rear light assembly I haven't been able to figure out where the problem is. Has anyone had this same problem? Or can anyone help me to troubleshoot the issue? Edit: I've already tried changing the bulb.
Sorry for all of these CBV posts, I always feel like the enthusiasts on this page are getting tired of seeing them. Anyways, I ordered my CBV XC40 in April, and yesterday when I called my concierge, they told me that the deliveries are stalled indefinitely and they can't get the paperwork established in the US with Liberty Mutual so the program might get completely cancelled. They'll still operate it in foreign markets. Anyone else get the same thing told to them?
recently got my _NUMBER_ runner, and I noticed that right below the radio, there is a little closable pocket. its barely big enough to hold anything, so i was wondering if any of you fine gentlemen have modified that area in any way so as to make more effective use of space?
I am thinking of buying a select mini as my first 3d printer. Do you have to mod it to make it useable? If so which mods are important and which are a nice to have? I will only be using it for very basic prints for myself. Like camera mounts, cases and models. I will stick to machining for important items.
Hey all as the title says I'm looking to buy my first truck for under 15k. I've seen a fair amount of _NUMBER_ - _NUMBER_ models that seem to fit the bill. I've been looking at a lot of Ford and Rams. Any advice on which one to get over the other would be appreciated!
Thanks in advance! My _NUMBER_ 535i oil level sensor is fucked. I'm confused manly because I don't know the difference between bmw part numbers, and interchange part numbers. I want to know why some sellers say my car will take _PHONE_ for $ _NUMBER_ and some say it wont, only _PHONE_ for $ _NUMBER_ . Did it change in _NUMBER_ ? Will the _NUMBER_ one not function or seal? Thank you!
It was only in the rain for a couple of minutes and it's almost dry. Anyways I turned it on (never happened to me before so I'm not sure if this was a dumb mistake or not). The radio panel is completely off, nothing in the display just all black. I have a _NUMBER_ sport, nothing fancy. Any advice would be helpful! I'm just trying to wait it out now. Thanks! UPDATE: It worked the next day, I just had to let it dry
This is driving me insane. It sounds like a loud mouse squeaking every time they operate (and its winter in Vancouver right now. There's A LOT of rain) I've tried lifting the blades up and they still squeak when there's no contact with the glass so it's either the motor or the arms themselves. Tried spraying some WD40 onto the bolts and surrounding areas and tightening the bolt that holds the arms in and the squeaking goes away for about10 minutes then starts again. Any other product I can try or somewhere else I can try lubing them?
I just replaced the adapter seal and oil cooler gasket on my b7 a4 quattro _NUMBER_ .0t. Besides being an enjoyable pain in my ass, the oil pressure light is on, and my oil is full. It's been almost _NUMBER_ miles of driving, and at this point, I figured it would have gotten all of its kinks out. Anyone have any insights on it? I've been told it could be an air bubble, my research says it could be sludge, and it could also be the oil pump or the sensor. Is it by chance something stupid that no one will put in the notes on doing this job? Extra info: I've been doing oil changes no later than 5k miles. It has 128k on the odometer. I've replaced the filter within the last 2k miles. It has no upgrades that pertain to the oil system. Any information would be appreciated. Edit: I also should have mentioned that in driving it, it felt and sounded better than it has for a while. Nothing seems to be an issue with the car at all, from what I can tell, except something is triggering that light. My gauges are all normal, and it seems to love the lack of a slow leak.
I know this isnt HD or Bike related, nor is this a fucking help desk so apologies in advance, but I'm just curious if any other RES users are having problems with the color format here on r/Harley? I have to turn night mode on or the OP posts and anything I click on is whiteed-out. Only happens on r/Harley. I can see the text if I highlight it. Turning Nightmode ON fixes it, so not a huge deal, but it made me wonder if this is just me, this Subs css or if its a RES issue edit RES = Reddit Enhancement Suite v5.10.3
Just bought a _NUMBER_ Skoda Roomster with 160k on it and I have no idea how to maintain the _NUMBER_ TDI engine. Is there a maintenance schedule to follow? I have a receipt showing the water pump and timing built were done recently along with the oil. How often should I change the oil? Thanks and I'm loving the ride!
