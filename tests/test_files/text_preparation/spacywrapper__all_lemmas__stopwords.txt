i seriously doubt the timing of the high mileage cpo be accidental but it seem like interesting timing to i so i 've be try to think through what the motivation would be for add all these low cost model s cpos a month before production be suppose to start for the model _number_ here be some thought _number_ someone suggest they may expect the value of their pre own inventory to depreciate significantly with the release of model _number_ so they be try to cash out while they can if true that would actually make these cpos not a good buy right now but they do not previously sell use car with such high mileage right if they be aggressively cut the price on the low mileage pre owned that would indicate a cash out but i be not sure here as i think this be a totally new category _number_ it be possible the sale have slow as people be wait for the model _number_ and this be a way for they to drive some extra revenue without do any major pivot in the company in fact if they be already prepare to have to do extra service on the increase fleet of model 3s on the road do some refurbish work on the used car could be a good way to keep the increase workforce for that busy as they build up to capacity and during any downtime _number_ also assume sale may be slow this quarter not actually sure if that be true or not sell as many cpos as they can this month would help boost their financial a bit before the quarter end would not help with delivery target for new car but would increase revenue _number_ even if they achieve what would under any other circumstance be consider a good and smooth ramp up to full scale production there be no way they be go to live up to some of the expectation out there this help alleviate some of that pressure by give some of those wait to spend ~$35k on a car a fast way into a tesla and again boost revenue a bit move forward regardless of how production ramp up i hope that be not their primary motivation as i doubt it will make that much of an impact in that regard _number_ they be offer a taste of the more premium car sort of like the idea of give a p100d loaner while your car be be repair with the hope that you will love it and buy a high end car next time this could be a bit of a gateway to move would be model _number_ owner into model s owner and eventually get they to buy new car from they _number_ sort of the opposite of _number_ but they may be expect a large influx of people move from the old model s to a new model _number_ and want to trade in those high mileage car now they have a program in place to resell those when the time come any other thought on why they would have time the high mileage cpo program like this i be fascinated with try to think through why they do thing how and when they do they

i try to post this in /r car but it be remove for some reason i be not in the market for a new subaru right now our forester be awesome i just like new car and know about they maybe you all would be more interested i 've be unsure about this for a while so i 've do some research what be the distinct difference between the impreza hatchback and the crosstrek and what make one well than the other or more suited to certain situation i 've find out a lot but i be sure i be miss thing as well here be the pro that i 've find for each _tag_ _number_ door low price the impreza _number_ door start almost $ _number_ cheap than the crosstrek well fuel economy in particular highway mileage be well interior material this be a pro for both side because it be really personal preference but some material use on the impreza be soft nicer drive experience this be subjective of course but be low to the ground would make the impreza a bit more nimble on average if only the engine and manual transmission be well _tag_ increased ride height this contribute mainly to a bit well all weather and off road capability but some folk just like sit higher up too plastic body cladding it look more like a crossover which people seem to like these day interior material again personal preference the crosstrek use some material that be more rugged and easy to clean extra off road capability this include x mode which optimize torque distribution for low speed traction when you need it and hill descent control which do similar stuff when go downhill well manual transmission this be a big deal for i the _number_ crosstrek get a much well _number_ speed manual like the forester while the impreza still have the crappier _number_ speed it be not just the extra gear that matter the impreza shifter just feel very imprecise towing official tow rating of _number_ lbs while the impreza be not tow rate thank to /u guiltydoggy and /u mevildaygo those be all of the difference i can find can anyone else think of any or do you have an unrelated reason to pick one over the other by the way if either car would adopt an engine that be quick and more torque y than the na _number_ .0l that would give it huge bonus point in my book edit add tow to crosstrek list

in the last episode i dispense the wisdom of how to not clean your throttle body so it ruin your jeep today 's lesson be how to not install a cb antenna so your trailer light stop work prior to add your cb antenna it be important to have work trailer light otherwise i can not guarantee that improper installation of your cb antenna will be the cause of the trailer light not work as be my case it be also important to install your cb antenna just before a big road trip and to also not re check your trailer light until right when you be plan to leave the placement of your cb antenna mount be important to ensure that your trailer light stop work it should be close to your driver 's side tail light so that reach the bolt to tighten the mount require you to remove the tail light assembly and for convenience disconnect the plug to say tail light assembly here be the critical step you must not mark the placement of the two electrical plug to the tail light assembly next insert the cb antenna mount bolt into the hole you have to drill in the back quarter panel cut your knuckle on the many sharp edge jeep have strategically place inside the cavity behind the taillight assembly and tighten the cb antenna mount completely now when re instal the taillight assembly it be recommend to simply guess at which plug come from where there be only two so you have a _number_ _number_ chance of get it right then tighten the two screw that hold the taillight assembly in place now step back and marvel at your genius then forget what you have do this be also crucial when it come time to panic at what could possibly be the reason your trailer light be not work i recommend on the morning of your big road trip to run late also make sure it be an extremely hot day then load your entire family into your jeep before you hook up your trailer i be certain that you all have spot my big error and the reason for the trailer light not work when i finally figure it out i be blow away by not only my idiocy but also by how easy of a mistake it be the two plug that go into the driver 's side taillight assembly be identical and as such can easily be accidentally switch so if you find yourself in a situation where your trailer light inexplicably stop work check the connection to the driver 's side taillight edit i should also mention that the weekend trip be a success despite the _number_ minute delay start

i be the kind of owner that if something do not happen _number_ times i write it off as a fluke and go on with my life but i be at a local home depot and when i return to the s the key fob would absolutely not work side of car front of car behind car button push nothing it be like the fob be completely dead and it have a battery only a week old so i take a video that last about _number_ second of i ridiculously wave the fob around the car like harry potter and the unresponsive tesla and finally place the fob on the secret windshield spot which take about _number_ second before the door release then off to my trusty service center for an opinion they say be it the home depot on such and such to which i reply yes it appear that either an over zealous cell tower that happen to have am as well as cellular and/or the wireless security system sensor or cellular paging might have be the culprit to drown out the ~300mhz spectrum to which they rattle off about _number_ location in my city that have similar problem most with readily noticeable antenna array nearby so all that to say if your fob stop work it might actually be an environmental cause and you should immediately switch to your app until you be out of that area and you can verify this with your service center because they 've probably see it before obviously this do not apply to model _number_ keycard or model x bluetooth ish

the end of trip screen twice a year i drive from ohio to massachusetts to visit family a _number_ + mile trip one way this be the first such trip since i pick up my _number_ volt i love long drive so i be eager to try this in the volt there be no question it can be do but i be curious if i could make the trip comfortably and hit my usual refueling spot turn out it can be do reasonably well the above number be with cruise control set at 73 mph 118kph for the majority of the trip and with the ac set to 72f 22c in eco mode i use the battery for travel off the highway and for acceleration to cruise speed where i would then switch to hold mode to get the most from the ice engine this be by far the good mileage i 've ever have in a car i 've own i be pretty stable at _number_ .3mpg until i hit the mountain in eastern ma so i average only _number_ for the trip but since my goal be 37mpg+ to hit my planned refueling stint this be very impressive to i not use gas to accelerate to cruise speed and the voltec design allow an atkinson cycle engine to stay in it 's most efficient range really help _number_ + mpg from a 3500 lb car do 73 mph with ac run be damn good there be a couple thing i discover most importantly the volt will use the battery to supplement the power the ice be generate for acceleration the majority of the ev mileage in the picture be do while in hold mode i would see the engine recharge the battery a little bit but not enough to replenish all that be use i have more than enough for my trip but i think that if i be to attempt a 1000mi trip i would have to either use mountain mode to maintain acceleration and sacrifice gas mileage or let the charge hit zero and run in basically a limp mode not a big deal since i think a _number_ hour trip be my limit the fuel door can be open while the car be still on this be both surprising and helpful it be nice be able to leave the car on for my wife while i refuel the gen _number_ volt do not need a bug deflector usually on these trip in the summer the whole front of the car will be cover in dead bug this time i think there just be not many bug out this year but at the end of the trip i find that the nose be cover in bug splat but the windshield be nearly clean seem the aerodynamic be just about perfect to keep bug from impact on the windshield at highway speed i 've own an audi and a cadillac in the past the caddy have gm 's magnetic damper which be consider some of the good for ride quality my volt be almost as nice to road trip in as either of those car for half the price ride quality be great and cabin noise level be superb my only gripe be that the seat could use more adjustment option can not wait for the trip home i be concerned about do this trip in the winter however anyone know if the hvac system use the coolant for heat if the ice be run i may need to do some practice run when the temperature drop the more i drive this car the more i be impressed with it and surprise by how much i be actually enjoy it it be convince i that ev be the perfect car for short trip around town and now this ice ev arrangement like a diesel locomotive seem to be a great configuration for long trip my only wish be that the fuel tank be a little big _number_ 15gal and that the voltec drivetrain be available in a more fun luxurious body but overall i think the volt be the hidden gem of gm 's lineup
